Successor of TIM
================

- In **1992** Luc started to write TIM, a framework for writing
  applications for SMEs in East Belgium.

- There are still about 20 TIM users.  Most of them use TIM for
  invoicing and accounting.
  
- TIM is written in dBase/Clipper/Xbase++. No mouse.  

- TIM has survived the switch from BEF to EUR, the switch from DOS to
  Windows and Luc's moving from Belgium to Estonia.
  
- The longest-running (known) TIM installation is a local heating
  systems installer in Eupen who upgraded in **2015** after having
  used a version from **1994** for more than **20 years**.
  
- Lino is the successor of **TIM**
  
- Before discovering Python and Django, Luc tried C++, PHP and Java.
