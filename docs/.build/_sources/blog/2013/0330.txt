Finishing :ref:`welfare.jobs.JobsOverview`:

- In ::mod:`lino.utils.appy_pod`, renamed `html2odf` to `ehtml`

- In the `Default.odt`, changed document header and default text style.

- Converted :meth:`lino.ui.ui.ExtUI.ar2html` to use 
  :meth:`lino.core.tables.TableRequest.get_field_info`.
  Visible result is that the columns of the preview have 
  the wanted widths distribution.

- Better docstrings at different places.


How to install python-uno in a virtualenv on Debian Squeeze
-----------------------------------------------------------

I have a virtualenv "demo" which has been created without 
site-packages. This Python interpreter, as expected, doesn't 
find any `uno` module: ``import uno`` raises an `ImportError`.
And I could not find any pypi package to be installed using pip.

Solution: the `uno.py` is in :file:`/usr/share/pyshared`. 
Just add this directory to your PYTHONPATH.

There are different methods to achive this; for me the easiest seems 
to create a file `local.pth` in 
:file:`/usr/local/pythonenv/demo/lib/python2.6/site-packages` 
with one line of text: `/usr/share/pyshared`.

Another problem was to have the openoffice daemon start.
Because at first my :srcref:`/bash/oood` didn't seem to work, 
I surfed around and found 
an almost identical one, but LSB compatible, 
in a `blog post by Glenn Enright
<http://thepocketsite.com/blog/2010/10/12/openoffice-headless-mode/>`_.
This is now in :srcref:`/bash/openoffice-headless`.
