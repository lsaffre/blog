Continued on :ref:`eidreader`
-----------------------------

Yesterday I `asked for help 
<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/eid-applet/mO8mqsvuMFc/I8yM1hH6OtcJ>`__
on the mailing list of the `eid-applet` group, and half an hour later 
Frank answered. Thanks!
He suggests to try with the recently released version 1.1.0.

- Changed `Manifest.txt` so that it no longer hard-codes a specific 
  version of `eid-applet-service.jar`, `commons-logging.jar` 
  and `commons-codec.jar`
  
- Started to write installation instructions at :ref:`eidreader.install`.
  (Also tried to do this on github, but got stuck because I didn't figure 
  out how to make internal links between different pages of their wiki)
  
Result: Great! It works!

To be more precise: the parser no longer causes an error,
now it is again *my* code which needs to evolve:
I must discover how to convert the information returned 
by the parser into what i want.

16:30 the last problems are solved! :ref:`welfare` no longer uses 
use_eid_jslib but eidreader to read id cards!

- Fixed a bug which caused manual callbacks (other than simple 
  confirmations) to fail.
  
- Lino now expects the EIDReader applet to be in a directory 
  `media/eidreader` which usually will be a symbolic link to the 
  :file:`applets` directory of the :ref:`eidreader` repository.
