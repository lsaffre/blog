:ref:`welfare.reception.WaitingGuests` : when clicking in that table 
on the partner, Lino-Welfare should show the *Client's* and not 
the *Partner's*  detail. Because in Lino-Welfare the `partner` of a 
`cal.Guest` is always a `Client`.

I solved this by creating a new class: 
:class:`lino_welfare.modlib.reception.WaitingGuests`
which overrides the library `reception.WaitingGuests`, 
adding a virtual field `partner` which will override 
the field defined in the model::

    class WaitingGuests(WaitingGuests): 
        label = WaitingGuests.label 
        
        @dd.virtualfield(dd.ForeignKey('pcsw.Client'))
        def partner(self,obj,ar):
            return pcsw.Client.objects.get(pk=obj.partner.pk)
        
Note that the label of a table is by design not automatically inherited.
That's why we must inherit the label manually.
