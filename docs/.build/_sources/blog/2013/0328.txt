Final spurt before the next release
-----------------------------------


- Internal Server Error at `/auth` when there was no action name, 
  no username and/or no password specified.

- Tried to find a way to have appy_pod renderer send a message or 
  do some other action when an error occurs. 
  Without succes. Posted a `question
  <https://answers.launchpad.net/appy/+question/225356>`_.
  
- The template for a Budget didn't yet include the new 
  `welfare.debts.DebtsByBudget` table.
  

About virtual fields
--------------------

A very subtle thing: :class:`debts.PrintEntriesByBudget 
<lino_welfare.modlib.debts.models.PrintEntriesByBudget>` 
is a VirtualTable which defines one column `partner`. 
We might simply declare it like this::

    @dd.displayfield(_("Partner"))
    def partner(self,obj,ar):
        return obj.partner
  

But it is better to define it like this::
  
    @dd.virtualfield(models.ForeignKey('contacts.Partner'))
    def partner(self,obj,ar):
        return obj.partner
        
This is because we really want it to simulate a (read-only) ForeignKey 
to Partner. This won't make the field editable (e.g. you'll not 
get a ComboBox on that field), but certain properties like the *preferred 
display width* and the *verbose name* have default values as if it were a real 
FK to `contacts.Partner`. Also, when this table is being rendered 
in a ExtJS HTML panel, the partner's name will be clickable and open the 
detail window for that partner.

(I wrote this because today I discovered and fixed the bug that the 
*verbose name* was *not* set correctly.)
