ExpectedGuests wird nicht mehr benutzt. Stattdessen 
wird 
in der `admin_main.html` 
"Meine Termine heute" (:ref:`welfare.cal.MyEventsToday`) 
angezeigt.

This revealed another bug. The following snippet verified that user 
rolf, in a freshly initialized welfare demo database, had exactly one 
calendar event:

>>> import os
>>> os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'lino_welfare.settings.demo'
>>> from lino.api.shell import *
>>> ses = settings.SITE.login('rolf')
>>> ses.spawn(settings.SITE.modules.cal.MyEventsToday).get_total_count()
1

It failed because :meth:`lino.core.requests.BaseRequest.spawn` 
called `setup_from()` *after* the instantiation. 
Which made that `default_params` was being evaluated when the user 
of the child request hasn't yet been inherited.. 

Two other subleties: 
(1) it was not possible until now to specify 
a `limit=5` when calling :meth:`lino.core.requests.BaseRequest.show`.
Or more precisely it was accepted but ignored.
And (2) there is a new overrideable class method 
:meth:`lino.core.tables.AbstractTable.apply_cell_format`.

The above snippet is now already obsolete. There is no more 
`MyEventsToday` table because `MyEvents` has become more flexible: 
shows also future events (today being visually enhanced using 
:meth:`lino.core.tables.AbstractTable.apply_cell_format`)


Started new module :mod:`lino.modlib.families`.
