=====================================

Updated :mod:`lino.modlib.vocbook` and http://cfr.saffre-rumma.net 
for my French students.

:ref:`faggio` is waiting for user feedback.
Okay I could continue e.g. with :ref:`eidreader`.
But then Kai sent a new feature list for their SacredPy project.
Guess which project got my attention today?
Yes, I chose the project which promised more fun:
I started :ref:`polly` 
(:mod:`lino.modlib.polls` and :mod:`lino.projects.polly`).
