==================================

Lino-Welfare:

- Fixed a little bug: 
  the `admin_main.html` template of Lino-Welfare displayed
  :ref:`welfare.pcsw.UsersWithClients` also to 
  users without permission to view it. 

- DispensesByClient and ActivityReport had wrong `required`.

Framework:

- Lino is now able to render
  `GenericForeignKey` fields correctly in a Grid.

- Removed a temporary exception "20120521 More than 300 items in %s"

  
Lino-Faggio:

- The `invoiceable` field (a `GenericForeignKey`) is now rendered 
  using a clickable link to the invoiceable's detail window.


TODO: 

- The "Fill" action is not enough: we need a main menu action 
  "generate all invoiceable invoices", 
  a table of all invoiceables, ...

- Move the "invoiceable" code from :mod:`lino_faggio.models` to 
  :mod:`lino.modlib.sales`
