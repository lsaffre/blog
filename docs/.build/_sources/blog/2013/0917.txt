Still fiddling on :ref:`davlink`
--------------------------------

I set up a testing environment for davlink on hoppel. So that I now can 
reproduce the problem which occured only on a Windows client.

Tried to get rid of the "Could not load Shockwave Flash" message in Chromium
as explained `here
<http://linuxologist.com/01general/howto-chromium-browser-on-linux-with-flash/>`_
... (didn't work)



- `Default Policy Implementation and Policy File Syntax
  <http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/PolicyFiles.html>`_

- `Mixing Signed and Unsigned Code / 
  Ensuring Application and Applet Security  
  <http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/mixed_code.html>`_

- Oho, finally this document was the path to enlightment:
  `Setting Privileges for Extensions
  <http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/ext/security/policy.html>`_.
  It says:

    If a Security Manager is in force, the following conditions must 
    be met to enable any software, including extension software, to 
    perform security-sensitive operations:

    - The security-sensitive code in the extension must be wrapped 
      in a PrivilegedAction object.
      
    - The security policy implemented by the security manager must 
      grant the appropriate permission to the extension. 

After wrapping the relevant code parts into PrivilegedAction 
objects, everything now seems to work like a charm.
