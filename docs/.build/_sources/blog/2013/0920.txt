- :menuselection:`Explorer --> System --> User Profiles` 
  now displays the UserLevel for each UserGroup.
  

Fixed a problem which occured when running initdb_demo for cosi and presto
because their Declarations journal had no account::

  IntegrityError: Problem installing fixture '...': 
  Could not load ledger.Journal(pk=None): ledger_journal.dc may not be NULL


welfare didn't yet pass test_sdist. Now it does.


Changed :meth:`Client.get_active_contract 
<lino_welfare.modlib.pcsw.models.Client.get_active_contract>`
as requested by the users: "Don't look into the past or future, 
only today matters".


Continued on :mod:`lino.modlib.ledger`.
