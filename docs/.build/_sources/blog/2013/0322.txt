================================


Renamed `users.Group` to `users.Team` to avoid the name conflict with 
:class:`lino.utils.auth.UserGroups`. 
Because "Team" is how the users in Eupen call it. 
A Team is a group of users who meet regularily and have a common set of rules.
:class:`lino.utils.auth.UserGroups` still should be renamed.

pcsw_demo_test is back. 
I disabled many of the hard-to-maintain cases
and did a big effort to define and maintain list of queries to test.

:class:`djangosite.utils.test.RemoteAuthTestCase`

There are tests which are much easier to write and maintain using doctest:
new page :ref:`welfare.tested`.

Lino now defines a version of dtos which supports IncompleteDate.
