Continuing on :ref:`faggio`.

When the user clicks "Confirm" on  an Enrolment, 
Lino now checks whether there are 
available places left in that course.
If not, the user gets an error message.

Another possible verification would be whether the pupil has overdue credit.



Replaced the EventsByController
slave table in CourseDetail by a new table 
EventsByCourse.
The difference is that now we can manually add more events 
to a course than the automatically generated ones.

Note that such manual events currently do not get the 
room, start_time and calendar fields filled.
