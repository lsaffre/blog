========

Yesterday evening I concluded that 
:srcref:`docs/tickets/74` is impossible to solve.
But after some hours of sleep I changed my mind again:

  `settings.LINO` will become `settings.SITE`,
  and `lino.Lino` will become `django_site.Site`.
  
And I even made everything public and moved that code to a new project `django-site
<https://code.google.com/p/django-site/>`_.
  
And the only visible difference is a new mention "django-site 0.0.1" 
in the using string.

If you look at the diff (:checkin:`ec7ed8317862`)
you'll agree that this was quite some work for a Saturday.

But I'm really glad I did it!


TODO:

- move also dumpy and babel to django-site. 
- change babel to do nothing if `Site.languages` is None.
- split the docs. What will be the home url for django-site?
