"'NoneType' object is not iterable" error
in `/home/luc/hgwork/lino/lino/core/tables.py` 
in setup_ventilated_columns, line 1156

:mod:`lino.projects.homeworkschool` was broken
after the evolutions in :mod:`lino.modlib.school` 
caused by :mod:`lino_faggio`.

Added another general test case in :mod:`lino.ui.tests.lino_ui_tests`
which automatically tests whether the index page after authentication 
works.
Because a trivial bug "no data element 'place' in cal.EventDetail" 
had slipped through the suite. 


New virtual table 
:class:`lino.modlib.school.models.InvoiceablesByPartner`.

:attr:`lino.core.actor.Actor.master` is now allowed to contain a 
string which will be resolved during startup.
