========

We had a Belgian eID card of type 16 ("Foreigner card E+"), 
but Lino had stored this as type 1 ('Belgian citizen').

Surfed and researched about 
:class:`BeIdCardTypes <lino_welfare.modlib.pcsw.models.BeIdCardTypes>`: 
is there an official list? 
Renamed BeIdCardType to BeIdCardTypes.
Could not find any bug in Lino.
Added new command :menuselection:`Explorer / eID card types`.
Added a logger.info() call so that next test yields more information.
