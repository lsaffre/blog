Miscellaneous
-------------

- :ref:`watch_tim` caused an error "The database backend does not 
  accept 0 as a value for AutoField." when TIM wrote a changelog for 
  `PAR:0000000`.
  
- Adding a new account in :ref:`welfare.accounts.Accounts`
  caused an internal server error `DoesNotExist`.
  
- :ref:`welfare.pcsw.ClientsTest` produced a traceback
  `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'strip'` for Clients 
  with national_id is None.
  
- New actions MoveUp and MoveDown, renderable in a column "move_buttons".
  First use case is :ref:`welfare.debts.EntriesByBudget`

- `auto_fit_column_widths` was ignored when a table was being 
  displayed as the main grid of a window.
  The code to generate the js code for viewConfig was duplicated,
  viewConfig  was generated once for the GridPanel subclass 
  definition and a second time when instantiating a slave grid. 
  Removed the second time.
