parameters for `cal.Guests`
---------------------------

:mod:`lino.modlib.cal` and :mod:`lino.modlib.reception`:

Added parameters to `cal.Guests`
and reimplemented the "Expected Guests" and "Waiting Guests" tables.

Discovered and fixed an internal bug in the development version 
which was there since :blogref:`20130605`:
When a table overrides `param_defaults`, then these are meant to be the 
default values of parameter fields. But this wasn't taken into account any more, e.g. 
`pcsw.IntegClients` now showed all clients by default instead of only 
those coached by the requesting user.

`blogref` links
---------------

`blogref` links had been pointing to the 
.rst version of the blog entry.
Now they finally point again to the real blog entry.
TODO: make the blog location configurable, 
see :func:`atelier.sphinxconf.get_blog_url`.
