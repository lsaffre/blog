I moved the `saffre-rumma.net` domain from my home-run web server 
to a virtual private server. Because:

- The heat produced by the constantly running machine
  caused extensive ice formation on our house's roof
  in winter, which damages the material.
  Instead of investing in better isolation, a cooling system, 
  a system administrator and finally becoming another host provider, 
  I decided to remain a simple programmer.

- I don't really need `saffre-rumma.net` for the moment but decided 
  to not close it.
  
Still looking for a gallery software for my private photo collection:

- Tried to setup
  `django-photo-albums <https://bitbucket.org/kmike/django-photo-albums/>`
  within a :mod:`north` application.
  Which would be a first example of this kind of combination.
  But abandoned before any visible result because I felt that this is 
  not the way to get a quick result.
  
- Discovered `tgapp-photos 
  <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tgapp-photos>`_
  and `TurboGears <http://turbogears.org/>`_.
  Oufti! This looks promising but it is a lot of new stuff for me.
