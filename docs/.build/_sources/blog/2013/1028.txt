NameError at /api/courses/CoursesByLine
---------------------------------------

Displaying the detail of a course line 
caused an :ref:`ise` "global name 'format_time' is not defined"

To fix the bug was a matter of two minutes. But then... 

... but then wanted to quickly write a test case which reproduces 
this bug.
This is tested by doing an http GET using the Django test client.
I had a series of similar tests in :ref:`welfare`.

But these tests have always been rather difficult to maintain.
I realized that I want a new kind of test case
which does something similar to what until 
now was possible only using tested docs: run a test on the demo 
database without having Django create and populate a test database.

Here is the result of several hours of work:
The new class :class:`lino.utils.test.DemoTestCase`,
`welfare_demo_tests.py
<http://code.google.com/p/lino-welfare/source/browse/tests/welfare_demo_tests.py>`_,
(the converted test case in :ref:`welfare`),
and `faggio_demo_tests.py
<http://code.google.com/p/lino-faggio/source/browse/tests/faggio_demo_tests.py>`_,
(the case which has caused all this work).
