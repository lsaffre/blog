========


- More changes in :class:`djangosite.Site`:
  - renamed `short_name` to `verbose_name`
  - removed `description`
- Moved the local site_setup system from Lino to Djangosite.
  System admins must rename all "lino_local" modules to "djangosite_local"
  and the `on_init` therein to `setup_site`.
  
  
One of the many little problems I had today::

  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "c:\Python27\lib\site-packages\fabric\main.py", line 739, in main
      *args, **kwargs
    File "c:\Python27\lib\site-packages\fabric\tasks.py", line 353, in execute
      results['<local-only>'] = task.run(*args, **new_kwargs)
    File "c:\Python27\lib\site-packages\fabric\tasks.py", line 123, in run
      return self.wrapped(*args, **kwargs)
    File "T:\hgwork\fabfile.py", line 144, in setup_sdist
      run_setup('setup.py',args)
    File "c:\Python27\lib\distutils\core.py", line 238, in run_setup
      script_name
  RuntimeError: 'distutils.core.setup()' was never called -- perhaps 'setup.py' is not a Distutils setup script?
