Multilingual user docs using Sphinx's i18n
------------------------------------------

I worked on :mod:`djangosite.utils.fablib` to support an optional 
internationalized "user manual" per project.
The new aliases
`emu`, `umu`, `imu` and `cmu`
do for `/userdocs`
the same as the aliases 
`em`, `um`, `im` and `cm`
do for the Python code.

The project's `fabfile` must set `env.languages` to something like::

  env.languages = 'fr nl de'.split()


The new method :meth:`lino.core.model.Model.subclasses_graph`
generates a graphviz directive which



Upgrade Sphinx from 1.1.3 to 1.2b1
----------------------------------

Georg Brandl has released a new version of Sphinx and asked to test it.
The upgrade itself was smooth::

  Cleaning up...


I rebuilt the following sites:

- http://www.lino-framework.org/
- http://welfare-user.lino-framework.org
- http://welfare.lino-framework.org/
- http://site.lino-framework.org/index.html
- http://north.lino-framework.org/index.html


One little problem was because I had been using the fact that a hidden doctree was still visible in the sidebar. On http://www.lino-framework.org/ there is a heading "Suggestions du chef" which was a kind of manually written "best of" toctree. But the sidebar still was meant to show the official toctree. The new version forced me to remove the :hidden: and add a "Sitemap" section there. I think the new version is right, and I'll remove my "Suggestions du chef" section soon.



ValueError: need more than 1 value to unpack
--------------------------------------------

The following problem (which I didn't yet report to the mailing list) 
is still not solved in Sphinx 1.2b1::

  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "setup.py", line 3, in <module>

      value, tzoffset, _ = re.split('([+-]\d{4})$', value, 1)
  ValueError: need more than 1 value to unpack

The exception happens in Babel because Sphinx's gettext builder 
generates `POT-Creation-Date` headers without timezone information.
The generated .pot files contain::

  "POT-Creation-Date: 2013-04-01 07:09\n"

but it should be ::

  "POT-Creation-Date: 2013-04-01 07:09+0300\n"
  

Workaround for me is to find line 160 of `sphinx/builders/gettext.py` 
(below a comment "XXX should supply tz")::

    ctime = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M%z'),
    
and to replace it by::

    ctime = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M%z+0300'), # Estonian summertime
