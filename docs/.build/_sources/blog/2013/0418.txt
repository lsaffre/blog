AttributeError: 'Site' object has no attribute 'getlanguage_info'
-----------------------------------------------------------------

A little bug caused Tx25 documents to not be printable.
Fixing the bug took 5 minutes, plus another 25 minutes to 
write a testcase, this one as a "tested doc": 
:ref:`welfare.tested.cbss`.

This also revealed another error 
"AttributeError: 'Settings' object has no attribute 'LINO'"
in the template for printing a Tx25 (which just caused the version to 
not appear on the printed document)

Another bug
"Exception: Request <TableRequest pcsw.UsersWithClients.grid({})> was 
already executed"
caused the print table as pdf function to not work.
Tested in :ref:`welfare.tested.pcsw`

A third bug, 
"TypeError at /plain/pcsw/UsersWithClients, cannot serialize 90 (type int)"
was even more tricky to test. This one is in pcsw_demo_tests.

Installed Apache and mod_wsgi on hoppel
---------------------------------------

This revealed another bug due to threading side effects.


New project : Garden
--------------------

I created the project `django-garden`, meant to help creating automated 
Lino projects. But the first implementation isn't yet ready. 
And maybe is never going to be. While working on this I understood that 
it is probably better to generate "stupid" manage.py and wsgi.py files 
instead of doing sophisticated Python magics.
