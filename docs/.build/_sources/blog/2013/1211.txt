Updated the :ref:`demos` because the bug which I fixed yesterday
was still active there.


Django's :setting:`LANGUAGES` setting 
-------------------------------------

I realized that :setting:`LANGUAGES` still contains all Django
languages even on sites who have :setting:`languages` set.  The
expected behaviour is to reduce this array to only those languages
which are actually being used.  The bug was in :mod:`north.north_site`,
where I did the conversion too late: modifying :setting:`LANGUAGES`
has no effect when `settings` have been loaded.  Now it is fixed:

>>> import os
>>> os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'lino.projects.docs.settings.demo'
>>> from lino.api.shell import settings
>>> from __future__ import print_function
>>> print(settings.LANGUAGES)
[('de', 'German'), ('en', 'English'), ('es', 'Spanish'), ('et', 'Estonian'), ('fr', 'French'), ('nl', 'Dutch'), ('pt-br', 'Brazilian Portuguese')]



Converting `use_extensible` to plugin (continued)
-------------------------------------------------

Pooh! In a three-hours surgery session I made the 
`setup_media_link` thing pluggable. 

In your `settings.py` file, if you had `use_extensible` set 
to True, then you must now replace::

    class Site(Site):
        extensible_base_url = "foo"
        extensible_root = "bar"
    SITE = Site(globals())

by::

    class Site(Site):
        ...
    SITE = Site(globals())

    SITE.configure_plugin('extensible',
        media_base_url="foo",
        media_root="bar")

Documentation is still almost absent...
