Committing after midnight
-------------------------

I really like my method of having *at most one* blog entry per day where 
I write down everything I did that day, all projects mixed.

The :cmd:`fab ci` command then does a combined `commit` and `push` using 
either Mercurial or Git, specifying today's blog entry as commit message.

A subtle problem occured when I worked longer than midnight before 
committing: I needed to start a new blog entry just to 
"commit yesterday's work" (as happened e.g. on :blogref:`20130523`).

Now I can set a hard-coded TODAY date in such situations.
See :func:`atelier.fablib.get_current_date`
and :attr:`atelier.TODAY`
