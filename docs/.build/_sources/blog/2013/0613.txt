After talking with Marc I worked two hours 
on :mod:`lino_patrols` and updated the 
demo site.


Lino-Welfare:

- Added two new observed events 
  for client filters: 
  `ClientEvents.isip`
  and
  `ClientEvents.jobs`.

  Quick manual test seems to work.
  (The whole filtering is still waiting to receive 
  an exhaustive test suite...)
  
- overridden `get_siblings` for `debts.Entry` so that up/down 
  actions no longer fail when seqno's are spread accross 
  different account_types.
