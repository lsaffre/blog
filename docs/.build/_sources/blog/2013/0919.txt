Updated docs.

It's expensive to use Java!
---------------------------

The problem with :ref:`davlink` raising a SecurityException after 
the Java update has caused us a lot of work:

- Luc about 30 hours 
- Gerd about 10 hours
- Nicolas about 3 hours

- Plus the fact that users could not use Lino to generate 
  CVs from June until September.

The crucial missing piece was to wrap security-related actions
into a `PrivilegedAction` class, as described 
in `Setting Privileges for Extensions
<http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/ext/security/policy.html>`_.

Our problem is especially illustrative because it is so evident that 
all this work could have been avoided if I had known this trick before.

According to the docs this trick is *not* necessary for applets.
The trail about 
`Deployment <http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/index.html>`_
does not contain a single link to this article.
It is used for extensions and described in 
a trail "The Extension Mechanism" 
in the third subdivision (entitled "Specialized Trails and Lessons").

I believe that the Java documentation is really good... 
but either it is not up to date, or the `PrivilegedAction` incidentally 
works around some fatal bug...
