Some optimizations while diving into :ticket:`95`.  One thing seems
clear: this ticket touches deep into Lino's heart.

- New method :meth:`lino.core.actions.Action.is_window_action`.

- In :mod:`lino.modlib.about` I functionally replaced
  :class:`DetailLayouts` by :class:`WindowActions`. The latter is more
  complete since it includes insert layouts and action parameter
  layouts. Both tables are used in :ref:`welfare.tested.general`.

- :meth:`lino.core.layouts.BaseLayout.get_layout_handle` no longer
  expects an argument because anyway this argument was not used.

- Moved the :mod:`lino.core.elems` module to :mod:`lino.modlib.extjs`.
