When reading eID cards
======================

Discovered  :ticket:`127` and :ticket:`128`.

Fixed :ticket:`127` and added two lines in
:mod:`lino_welfare.projects.std.tests.test_beid` to test it.



Sphinx 1.3 has been released
============================

Takayuki Shimizukawa has released a new version of Sphinx.  I
converted the documentation for :mod:`atelier` to the new Alabaster
theme which I have been using before e.g. in `German Lino Welfare user
documentation <http://de.welfare.lino-framework.org/>`_ and which has
the advantage of being responsive. But there is one open question
before I can use it for the Lino docs: how can I get the "previous |
next | modules | index" links that used to be in the upper right
corner? Not urgent.


Checking primary addresses
==========================

I fixed :ticket:`127`, but how can we set the :attr:`primary
<lino.modlib.addresses.models.Address.primary>` flag for the address
of card holders that have been read from eID cards until now?

- I adapted the :meth:`get_primary_address
  <lino.modlib.addresses.mixins.AddressOwner.get_primary_address>` method.

- New test module :mod:`lino.projects.min2.tests.test_addresses`.

Now a first approach can be to write a local script to be executed
with the :manage:`run` command::

  from lino.api.shell import *
  for p in contacts.Partner.objects.all():
      p.get_primary_address(update=True)
      



Tidying up the API
==================

Above script motivated me to finally do another API change: rename
``lino.api.runtime`` to :mod:`lino.api.shell`.

And that caused me to remove finally those backwards-compatibility
modules ``lino.runtim``, ``lino.ad`` and ``lino.rt``.

The script in the previous section with old API would have been::

  from lino.runtime import *

Now it is::

  from lino.api.shell import *
