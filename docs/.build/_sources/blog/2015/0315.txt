Redirecting non-ascii stdout to a file
======================================

:manage:`repairdata` now supports positional arguments: if arguments
are specified, then they are expected to be full names of the
models to be tested.


I got UnicodeEncodeError when I wanted to redirect the output of
:manage:`repairdata` to a file. For example, in
:mod:`lino.projects.min2` the following command gives quite some
output, including Non-ASCII text::

  $ python manage.py repairdata

And it works, at least if the :envvar:`LANG` is correctly set.  But
redirecting that output to a file does not work::

  $ python manage.py repairdata > tmp.txt

And after having read posts like `this one
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11741574/how-to-print-utf-8-encoded-text-to-the-console-in-python-3>`__,
I added the following line to :mod:`atelier`::

    import sys, codecs, locale
    sys.stdout = codecs.getwriter(locale.getpreferredencoding())(sys.stdout)

That is: importing :mod:`atelier` now automatically adds a codecs
writer to `sys.stdout`.  I then discovered that as a consequence,
:mod:`atelier.doctest_utf8` is no longer needed.

Result is that I can now do the above redirection. And everything else
seems to work.
