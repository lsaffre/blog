===================================

I restarted to work on :ref:`noi` because Mahmoud and I are maybe
going to use it as ticketing system.  Added a new fixture
:mod:`lino_noi.fixtures.tractickets`.  Changes in
:mod:`ino.modlib.tickets`. New class `TimeInvestment`. I stopped to
try to import my old tickets and sessions from TIM. Yes you might say
that I am crazy. Why don't I use Trac or GitHub? Why must I reinvent
the wheel?

Fixed a bug which caused an AttributeError :message:`'NoneType' object
has no attribute 'attname'` during :class:`RefuseClient
<lino_welfare.modlib.newcomers.models.RefuseClient>`.  Could not
reproduce this problem on my machine, but found and eliminated the
obvious reason for it: :func:`add_system_note
<lino.modlib.notes.models.add_system_note>` used the library class
object instead of the overridden one.
