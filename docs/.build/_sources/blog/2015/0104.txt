Getting started on Travis
=========================

Tilt! (see yesterday) The test suite on travis fails because :cmd:`fab
initdb` has not been running. So in Lino's :file:`.travis.yml` I
replace::

  script: python setup.py test 

by::

  script: fab initdb test

And yes (Python is cool): it works. The next build successfully
`initializes all demo databases
<https://travis-ci.org/lsaffre/lino/jobs/45813031>`_.  


But still some test cases fail with an :message:`OperationalError: no
such table: users_user`. Strange.  I can reproduce it locally::

  $ cd ~/tmp
  $ virtualenv 0104
  $ . 0104/bin/activate
  $ go lino
  $ pip install .
  $ fab initdb test

Maybe it is because the database files (`default.db`) get written to
the source tree?  To be continued...


Error reporting :mod:`atelier`
==============================

I optimized :mod:`atelier` error reporting in some edge situations:

- :mod:`atelier.sphinxconf.blog` failed with a strange error message
  when trying to build a doctree with a :rst:dir:`blogger_index`
  directive but with no blog entry at all.

- When :func:`atelier.projects.add_project` was used to declare a
  project which had no :xfile:`fabfile.py`, this caused an irritating
  :message:`ImportError: No module named fabfile` even when a fab
  command was invoked from another project.

- I reformulated the error message :message:`Check doc_trees in your
  project's main module.` by :message:`Check your project's doc_trees
  setting.`
