A calendar navigator for my blog
================================

I spent two hours with optimizing :mod:`atelier.sphinxconf.blog`.  My
blog now features an automatic calendar navigator. I just wanted to
move the old years to a less visible place without loosing them from
the global toctree.  This blogging system contains blog entries since
2009 (though the first years were originally written in other formats
and are not yet fully converted)


Repairing data using a script
=============================

Yesterday we decided to write and run a rather simple but critical
batch operation in a production database.

Here is the script shortly before I actually ran it:

.. literalinclude:: 0331.py

I discovered that the `puts` of `clint
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/clint/>`_ does not like unicode
strings. What a pity! I also saw that `they know it
<https://github.com/kennethreitz/clint/issues/48>`_.

I wrote documentation for :class:`PseudoRequest
<lino.core.utils.PseudoRequest>` and moved it from :mod:`lino.api.dd`
to :mod:`lino.core.utils`.

Miscellaneous
=============

I updated some parts of the Lino documentation.

About plugin inheritance
========================

I removed another usage of :meth:`set_detail_layout
<lino.core.actors.Actor.set_detail_layout>` and of a magic
`site_setup` function, namely those which were in
:mod:`lino_welfare.models`.
