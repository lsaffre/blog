How to specify the aid type per Client
======================================

In :mod:`lino_welfare.projects.chatelet` they need either the
`pcsw.Client.aids_type` field or a minimal version of
:mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.aids` (the :class:`aids.GrantingsByClient
<lino_welfare.modlib.aids.models.GrantingsByClient>` panel in
pcsw.ClientDetail) in order to print this information on an ISIP
contract.  I activated the latter. It is more complicated than what
they ask (they ask for just a combobox) but more future-oriented.

Cannot save RichTextField when editing in own window
====================================================

And it seems that I also managed to fix ticket :ticket:`131`. Nice.

Miscellaneous
=============

:func:`lino.utils.ssin.unformat_ssin` now also removes periods (".").

The "Phonetic words" table in :ref:`welfare.tested.dupe_clients` was
skipped because it had been raising an exception. This was due to a
bug in :meth:`lino.core.tablerequest.TableRequest.row2text` which I
now fixed. It accessed `_lino_atomizer` directly, instead of callng
:func:`get_atomizer <lino.core.store.get_atomizer>`.  This works in
many cases... except for fields which are never used in any
hard-coded Layout. The `name` field of `pcsw.Clients` is such a
case.
