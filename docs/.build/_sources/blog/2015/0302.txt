Miscellaneous
=============

I discovered that Kevin Horn wrote a library called `rstgen
<https://bitbucket.org/khorn/rstgen/src>`_ which is comparable to my
:mod:`atelier.rstgen`.  TODO: Check whether we should join our
effords.

Payment orders
==============

I continued to work for payment orders in :ref:`cosi`.
New model :class:`ledger.MatchRule <lino.modlib.ledger.models.MatchRule>`.
