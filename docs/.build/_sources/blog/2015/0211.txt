============================

I decided that we won't let ticket :ticket:`95` touch as deep into
Lino's heart as I thought yesterday.  I created ticket :ticket:`96`
instead and simply use another layout as a workaround for
:ticket:`95`. And it turns out that the new layout is maybe even
better than our original plan. Anyway it caused two new features:

- New :class:`Plugin <lino.core.plugin.Plugin>` attribute
  :attr:`short_name <lino.core.plugin.Plugin.short_name>`.

- The tab panel of a detail window no has its `enableTabScroll
  <http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/3.4.0/#!/api/Ext.TabPanel-cfg-enableTabScroll>`_
  set to True to enable scrolling to tabs that may be invisible due to
  overflowing the overall TabPanel width.


And then I discovered (after quite some search because i had been
looking at the wrong place) why we couldn't see the icon of the
:class:`FindByBeIdAction <lino.modlib.beid.models.FindByBeIdAction>`.
The reason was Lino's :srcref:`.gitignore` file. It contained an entry
`media` and therefore the file :file:`vcard_add.png` had never been
included to the code repository.

Checkin and upgrade in :ref:`weleup` and :ref:`welcht`.


Registered two new tickets :ticket:`97` and :ticket:`98`.
