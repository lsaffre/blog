========

The Data Control Listing was too slow. Some more changes that go into 1.3.3:

- New field `body_html` now stores the result of `body()`.
  Removed fields 'header' and 'footer' because 
  ``do text from html(self.header())`` doesn't seem 
  to work when used in a page header or footer.
  Changed :file:`config/lino/DataControlListing/Default.odt`
  
- `.odt` files were missing in source distribution
  
- settings.LINO.site_config didn't update when the SiteConfig 
  record had been modified.
  
And there were some plain bugs in my algorithm.
Added new function :func:`lino.utils.overlap` with testcases.

CustomTable
-----------

In the evening I started a little revolution: I split about half 
of the code of :class:`lino.core.table.Table`
into :class:`lino.core.table.AbstractTable`
which becomes common base for 
the new :class:`lino.core.table.CustomTable` class.
A Custom Table doesn't work on a Model but on some arbitrary data.
First example is 
:class:`lino.apps.dsbe.models.OverviewClientsByUser`
who does exactly the same as
:func:`lino.apps.dsbe.models.persons_by_user`,
but in a very different way.

This change opens new dimensions for writing "Listings".
One "detail" is missing: how to do a user form for entering volatile parameters to such CustomTables.
