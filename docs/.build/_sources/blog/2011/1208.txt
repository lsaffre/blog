Configurable Work Schedules and Work Regimes 
--------------------------------------------

The lists of choices for fields 
jobs.Contract.schedule
and jobs.Contract.regime
are no longer hard-coded but configurable.
New models `jobs.Schedule` and `jobs.Regime`.


get_salutation
--------------

- When gender is empty, returns an empty string (instead of "Mr")

- Now uses internationalization instead of a hard-coded set of strings.
  This uses Django's `Contextual markers
  <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/i18n/translation/#contextual-markers>`_
  because in German, the string "Mr" must become either "Herr" or "Herrn" depending 
  on whether we want the "nomiative" or "indirect" form.
