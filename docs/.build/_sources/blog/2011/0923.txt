BCSS
----

There is not *one* .xsd file but a vast set of .xsd files, 
each of them, 
corresponding to the many services of the :term:`BCSS`.

Maybe Dave Kuhlmann's `generateDS 
<http://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman/generateDS.html>`_
module will be helpful to explore them.

startfile.js

News for :srcref:`docs/tickets/45`:
I found the answer to my question "Is there a method in Firefox to find out the full path 
application associated with a given file type in the client's desktop?"
(a question which I posted also in the German 
`selfhtml.de forum 
<http://www.selfhtml.de/forum/zeigebeitrag_2_134298_134298_0.php>`_).

The answer for Windows client is search the windows registry 
(`Accessing the Windows Registry Using XPCOM 
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Accessing_the_Windows_Registry_Using_XPCOM>`_).
For Unix and Mac clients the solution is less elegant,
but I'll wait for real use cases to investigate more on this.

Here is the new version of my :xfile:`startfile.js`:

.. literalinclude:: 0923/startfile.js

To be used from HTML code like this:

.. literalinclude:: 0923/startfile.html
