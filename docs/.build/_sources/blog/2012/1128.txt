Lino and Django 1.5
-------------------

`Django 1.5 beta 1 
<https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2012/nov/27/15-beta-1/>`_
is released.
I tested it and had a few surprises from harmless to positive,
but inadvertently lost my notes about them.


Assigning a calendar event
--------------------------

Continued on this. Not finished. 
Need to implement 
:meth:`lino.core.layouts.ActionParamsLayout.get_choices_url`.


Lino and humans
---------------

Yesterday's last-minute idea to use `self.client.gender.mf(m,f)` 
in a contract's document template 
was not the good solution: didn't work for people whose `gender` 
field is empty.
Replaced by `self.client.mf(m,f,u)`.

New module :mod:`lino.mixins.human`.
Choicelist `contact.Gender` renamed to `lino.Genders`.
Tested documentation in :mod:`lino.test_apps.human`.
