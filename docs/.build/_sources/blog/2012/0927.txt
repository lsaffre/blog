========

Started first implementations of "Client workflow": 
refusing a request to become client, 
marking a client "former".

ChoiceList.before_state_change
ChoiceList.after_state_change
Model.set_ch

Understood that we don't need "action parameters" 
but ar.dialog()
Started :mod:`lino.core.dialogs` 
and a first application code snippet to 
demonstrate the planned usage::


  class RefuseNewClient(dd.Dialog):
      title = _("Refuse new client")
      reason = models.CharField(max_length=200,verbose_name=_("Reason"))
      
  class ClientStates(ChoiceList):
      
      @classmethod
      def before_state_change(cls,obj,ar,kw,oldstate,newstate):
        
          if newstate.name == 'refused':
              dlg = ar.dialog(RefuseNewClient)
              obj.set_change_summary(dlg.reason)
              
      ...
