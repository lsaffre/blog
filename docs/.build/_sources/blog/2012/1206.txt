========

Working on :mod:`lino.apps.cosi`.

- labelWidth 80 -> 90 im Login-Fenster weil "Nom d'utilisateur" sonst nicht passte.
- insert_layout ledger.AccountInvoices
- user can now confirm an Insert window by pressing ENTER key 

- ledger and sales now :meth:`add_detail_tab 
  <lino.core.actors.Actor.add_detail_tab>` to 
  contacts.Partners, Persons and Companies

- ledger now uses accounts.MODULE_LABEL which changed from "Accounts" to "Accounting"
- new user group "accounting" defined in accounts

- :meth:`lino.utils.auth.UserProfiles.reset` 
  now supports the situation where a string of user groups is specified but doesn't 
  name all groups. This leads to a set of `default_memberships`. 
  For example, :mod:`lino.apps.cosi` uses module 'accounts' which now defines 
  usergroup 'accounting', but we didn't yet override 
  :meth:`lino.apps.cosi.Lino.setup_choicelists` to reflect this change.
  
- ledger invoices ("simple invoices") now have a column vat_class

Here a dependancy graph for the :mod:`lino.modlib` modules I'm working on.

.. graphviz:: 
   
   digraph foo {
   
      
      sales -> contacts;
      sales -> ledger;
      sales -> products;
      ledger -> accounts;
      ledger -> vat;
      accounts -> contacts;
      ledger -> contacts;
      vat -> contacts;
   }

It looks sophisticated, but nobody ever claimed that :mod:`lino.modlib` is a simple thing.

Note especially that :mod:`accounts <lino.modlib.accounts>` is being used in Lino/Welfare 
which does *not* currently use :mod:`ledger <lino.modlib.ledger>`.


TODO:

- ledger.Voucher should not define it's own detail_layout, but 
  `Movement.voucher` (the pointer to Voucher) should be clickable and link 
  to the detail of the one and only VoucherType MTI child of that Voucher.
