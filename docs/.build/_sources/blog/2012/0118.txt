========

There were several places (quick links, button actions) 
where Lino still used a `http:` URL. 
Now they also use the `javascript:` URL.

Continued another 4 hours with the CalendarPanel.
The permalink button now works.

`dt_start` and `dt_end` are now  
:class:`editable virtual fields 
<lino.modlib.cal.models.ExtDateTimeField>`
defined on the PanelEvents table,
no longer on the model itself. 
A nice confirmation for the recent internal changes.

The main challenge is the AJAX communication:
Lino's :meth:`lino.ui.extjs3.ext_ui.ExtUI.restful_view` 
and the configuration 
of the Ext.data.Store in :xfile:`linolib.js`.

No checkin because no visible success yet. 
Current problem is that the CalendarPanel store does a 
*POST* when I *move* an existing event to another date.
