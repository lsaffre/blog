========

Added two new "useless" modules:

- :mod:`lino.utils.xmlgen.intervat`  
  is not yet being used by Lino, but it helped me to understand
  these XML Schemas, and 
  :mod:`lino.utils.xmlgen.intervat.validate` was useful when implementing 
  them in TIM.

- :mod:`lino.modlib.vocbook` will maybe some day become 
  lino module, but currently it is usable only by people like 
  me who are both Python programmer and French teacher.
  I have been using this code for more than a year when I 
  needed to print vocabulary lessons for my students.
