========

:func:`lino.core.kernel.setup_site` now adds a new attribute `modules`
which makes it easy to directly address the installed modules. 
This is going to replace `resolve_action`.

And then another internal change that took me more than a day:
Actors no longer get instantiated. 
Application code simply uses the class object itself 
where there used to be a singleton instance.

The :meth:`lino.utils.menus.Menu.add_action` method 
(which is used heavily in 
:meth:`lino.Lino.setup_menu`
and
:meth:`lino.Lino.setup_quicklinks`) now gets the Actor's class 
instead of a string. That's more readable and probably also more 
efficient (which is not unimportant since these methods are called 
for every request).

One detail which I didn't like so much is that application programmers 
must not forget to decorate their overridden Table class 
methods as `@classmethod`.

I plan to also convert TableRequest to Table instances.
