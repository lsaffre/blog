Test suites pass again
----------------------

The unit test suite revealed another bug::

  INFO 20120103 /api/dsbe/CourseProviders?fmt=json&limit=30&start=0          
  INFO 20120107 Store <class 'lino.apps.dsbe.models.CourseProvider'>         
  row2list(Company #197 (u'Arbeitsamt der D.G.'))                            
  AttributeError: 'Company' object has no attribute 'company_ptr'            
  
This was because Tables are no longer singletons. 
The CourseProviders table request received Company objects instead of CourseProvider.
:attr:`lino.core.table.Table.base_queryset` was not None if the 
base table had had a request before.
The same effect probably happened for 
:attr:`lino.ui.base.Handled._handles`, 
(at least theoretically... it didn't become visible)
anyway now we also there make sure to "disconnect" 
from the the base class's `_handles` instance 
by creating a new dict() object for each handle.
Performance is not an issue there since this happens only once 
per UI and Table.

Now the test suites for both igen and dsbe pass again.

Remote fields
-------------

Added the possibility to specify fields on a related model 
through a ForeignKey using Django's ``__`` separator. 
First use case 
is :class:`lino.modlib.jobs.models.ContractsByUser`::

  class ContractsByUser(Contracts):

      column_names = 'person person__national_id person__gender applies_from applies_until job id user type *'

TODO: the default value for `preferred_width` isn't correct.

New ideas
---------

- Opened :srcref:`docs/tickets/53`, but this is going to wait until 
  there's concrete need.

- I realized that before continuing with 
  :srcref:`docs/tickets/52`
  (the last steps will probably be rather stupid routine work), 
  I prefer to find a 
  solution for generating printed reports more easily.
  Opened :srcref:`docs/tickets/54`.
