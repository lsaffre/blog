========

Uff! After about 23 hours of experimenting I have now for the 
first time a solution for the problem of rendering a formatted 
table to odt (or pdf or rtf) using :term:`appy.pod`.

:term:`ODFPy` has only a marginal role for generating the chunks of XML, 
the main work is done by the `finalizeFunction` of 
the :term:`appy.pod` renderer which inserts the additional "dynamic" 
styles *afterwards*  (when the document has been processed).

Concretely this is done in :mod:`lino.utils.appy_pod`
and demonstrated in 
:srcref:`/tests/appy/20120419/test.py`,
:srcref:`/tests/appy/20120419/test_template.odt`
and
:srcref:`/tests/appy/20120419/test_result.odt`.

Added a new minimal application :mod:`lino.apps.pim`.
