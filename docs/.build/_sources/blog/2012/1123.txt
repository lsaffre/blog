I had several hours of surf and thought about 
"GPL or BSD?" question and came to the conclusion 
that GPL remains my choice *for the moment*.

For those who are interested, please read the following page 
and tell me your advice about how I should decide:

  :srcref:`docs/tickets/16`

I also noticed that the file :srcref:`/COPYING.txt` 
was mistakenly still a version 2 of the GPL. 
Lino is and has always been distributed under the GPLv3.
