========

:mod:`lino.apps.cosi` : 
VAT declarations now have a "Register" and "Deregister" action 
and a Detail window.

- setup_menu now also calls setup_reports_menu. Used by 
  :mod:`lino.modlib.vat`.
  The "Reports" (or "Listings") menu 
  is supposed to contain commands for periodical analysis.
  
- New class :class:`dd.AuthorRowAction <lino.mixins.AuthorRowAction>`.
  This is maybe not really useful.

- New class :class:`lino.mixins.Registrable`

TODO:

- The Detail window has a slave table DocumentsByDeclaration which 
  is Lino's first case of merging two tables. Not yet really convincing.
