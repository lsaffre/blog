Ideas about :mod:`lino.modlib.tickets`.

Project is now BabelNamed.
Tickets are now related to a given Partner, not Projects.
Added new Model `Milestone`.


Fixed a bug in :mod:`lino.modlib.cal`:
KeyError at /
"Unknown element 'partner' referred in layout ListLayout on tickets.ProjectsByProject.Cannot handle None"
Request Method:	GET
