========

- :meth:`Person.update_reminders <lino.apps.pcsw.models.Person.update_reminders>` 
  didn't yet switch to the user's language.
  
- New function :func:`lino.utils.babel.run_with_language`
  used in 
  :meth:`Person.update_reminders <lino.apps.pcsw.models.Person.update_reminders>`,
  :class:`EventGenerator <lino.modlib.cal.models.EventGenerator>`,
  :class:`AppyBuildMethod <lino.mixins.printable.AppyBuildMethod>`.
  
- Renamed 
  AuthoritiesByUser to AuthoritiesGiven and 
  AuthoritiesByAuthorized to AuthoritiesTaken.

- AuthoritiesGiven and AuthoritiesTaken didn't work in MySettings. 
  Because the AJAX call had an empty :attr:`mk <lino.ui.requests.URL_PARAM_MASTER_PK>`.
  Due to a bug when `hide_top_toolbar` was `true` and `hide_navigator` not.
  
- AuthoritiesTaken isn't really useful. You can see the list of taken authorities 
  (those given to you by somebody else) automatically from the "Act as..." menu.
  Removed it from User Detail since it also made it possible to give 
  yourself an authority from another user.
  
- The "Act as..." menu for non-system-admin users 
  didn't show the user names (neither did it work).
  
- Added :menuselection:`Explorer --> Authorities` menu command.

- Added French translations to :mod:`lino.modlib.users`.

:checkin:`39ea0ba7ffcd`. This is probably going to be 
released as version 1.4.8
