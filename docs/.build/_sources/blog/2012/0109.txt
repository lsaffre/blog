========

I discovered that my first implementation of the new 
"remote fields"  feature
(part of :srcref:`docs/tickets/54`)
was too simple. Worked another 5 hours to get it running:

.. image:: 0109.jpg
  :scale: 90
  
The screenshot shows fields city, national_id  and gender from 
the Person of each Contract. Remote fields are always 
read-only.

Another nice detail:
ChoiceList fields always had a hard-coded 
default `preferred_width` of 20, which was too much for the 
Gender field, for example.
New class attribute 
:attr:`preferred_width <lino.utils.choicelists.ChoiceList.preferred_width>` 
which is automatically set to the maximum length of the choices 
texts (using default site language). 
Currently you cannot manually force it to a lower 
value than that. And it might guess wrong if the user language 
is not the default site language.

Checkin (test suite dsbe passes, igen is waiting some work on 
the generated demo invoices).
