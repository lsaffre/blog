===========================

The online example documents under
:xfile:`urgent_medical_care.body.html` have not yet been updated.

After quite some research I discovered that one of the reasons was the
fact that these printable files were not being re-build because their
old version was still in the cache.  I then discovered that
:mod:`atelier.fablib` in does have a function to clear the demo
caches. I just had forgotten that it was there.  And remeber that I
wrote 2 days ago that I "wrote a :cmd:`fab pyc` command which removes
`.pyc` files that don't have a corresponding `.py` file.  But will I
remember to run this command when it is time to do so?"  Result of
these: the :cmd:`fab clean` now does all these in one.

Another problem then was that they were in English, not in German.
This was due to a side effect happening in
:func:`atelier.sphinxconf.configure`: populating `intersphinx_mapping`
with urls to other projects must be done *after* the `from django.conf
import settings` line.
