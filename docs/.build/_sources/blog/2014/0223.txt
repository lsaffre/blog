In :mod:`lino.core.perms` I removed the warning "profile specified by
`anonymous_user_profile` is `authenticated`". This case is not worth a
warning.  When an application specifies her own
:setting:`anonymous_user_profile` then they are supposed to know what
they do.  At least in the case of :ref:`sunto` we want no user
management, and we want anonymous user to have root permissions.

TODO: It seems that the `FileUploadField` doesn't declare its height
correctly, because the height of the insert window is to small.  I
tried to add `config.value = '<br/><br/>';` in
`Lino.file_field_handler`, but that didn't help.
