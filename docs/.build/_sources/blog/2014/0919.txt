Continued to work on :srcref:`docs/tickets/124`.

- Using DummyFields in a Layout : the new feature (introduced
  yesterday) still caused a traceback "%s expects a list of 16 values
  but got 15"

- Increased :ref:`welfare` version to 1.1.17 and wrote a migrator
  :meth:`lino_welfare.projects.chatelet.migrate.Migrator.migrate_from_1_1_16`.

- Added new setting :attr:`ml.humanlinks.Plugin.person_model`.

- :ref:`welfare` now sets the `person_model` for both 
  :attr:`humanlinks <ml.humanlinks.Plugin.person_model>` and
  :attr:`household <ml.households.Plugin.person_model>`
  to `pcsw.Client`.
