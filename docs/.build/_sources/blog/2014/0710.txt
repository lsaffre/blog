Yesterday's UnicodeEncode bug in :mod:`ml.beid` was not yet correctly
fixed. I am shooting from the hip because my Belgian eID card contains
only ASCII characters, so I cannot easily test this.

Joe contributed a `bugfix <https://github.com/lsaffre/lino/pull/18>`_ 
for :mod:`lino.modlib.export_excel`.

Converted also the :ref:`davlink` Makefile to `fabfile.py`. The logic for building java classes and jars is now in :class:`atelier.fablib.JarBuilder`.
