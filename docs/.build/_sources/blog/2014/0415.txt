Data migration and `after_load`
-------------------------------

New method :meth:`north.dpy.Migrator.after_load`. 
Data migrations should no longer do::

   def f(loader):
       # do something after load
   globals_dict.update(after_load=f)

But::

   def f(loader):
       # do something after load
   self.after_load(f)

Until now it was (theoretically) possible that the `after_load` method
of one migration got overwritten by a next migration.


Converting Belgian NBANs to IBAN & BIC
--------------------------------------

New module :mod:`lino.modlib.sepa.utils` to convert a Belgian National
Bank Account Number to the corresponding IBAN and BIC. We need this
for data migration in :srcref:`docs/tickets/93`.  A first implementation used
the free public SOAP service available at `ibanbic.be
<http://www.ibanbic.be/IBANBIC.asmx?op=BBANtoIBANandBIC>`_. Unfortunately
this turned out to be too slow when we need to convert thousands of
NBANs. So I rewrote the whole thing based on my existing code from
TIM, and using a hard-coded list of Belgian bank codes (taken from
`nbb.be`).


Miscellaneous
-------------

I moved the `badges` app from :mod:`lino.modlib` to
:mod:`lino_welfare.modlib`.
