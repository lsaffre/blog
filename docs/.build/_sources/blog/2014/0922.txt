==========================

The `overview` panel of all partners in :ref:`welfare` now have a
"polymorphic navigator".  That is, you can easily switch between the
different polymorphic forms of a partner ("Partner -> Person ->
Client", "Partner -> Company -> JobProvider", ...)

This long-awaited feature is technically nothing new, but it took me
some time to imagine a satisfying way of integrating it and making it
reusable.  Side effects:

- Renamed :class:`lino.utils.mti.MultiTableBase` to
  :class:`lino.mixins.polymorphic.Polymorphic`.

- Fixed a bug in :meth:`dd.Model.print_subclasses_graph`. Example usage
  in :ref:`welfare.de.partner`.
