:mod:`lino_welfare.projects.chatelet` now have their own
:meth:`lino.core.site.Site.get_admin_main_items`.

Discovered Steve Johnson's `sphinx-better-theme
<http://sphinx-better-theme.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_.
Looks promising! And easy to try!  So I tried it on the docs for
:ref:`welfare`.  Opened `issue #29
<https://github.com/irskep/sphinx-better-theme/issues/29>`_ and hoping
for help.

Opened ticket :srcref:`docs/tickets/113`.
Marked ticket :srcref:`docs/tickets/112` as closed.
