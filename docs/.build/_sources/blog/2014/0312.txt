===================================

- Added miscellaneous translations to French.

- Added new body template for an attestation directly on pcsw.Client.
  Which caused two internal new features: 

    - ar.show() has a new keyword argument `header_level`.
    - New name `lino` in a template is shortcut for `settings.SITE.modules`

    
- Testing the reception clerk user profile in :ref:`welfare`. With
  Emilie and Vanessa.

- New action `ChangePassword` in `lino.modlib.users.models`. 
    
  TODO: But there is some bug
    
    
- New management command :manage:`gd2lino`.
