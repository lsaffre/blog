Updated the :ref:`demos`.
Continued with translation of :ref:`faggio`.


Fixed a bug reported by Mathieu:

- running ChangePassword on a newly created user does not actually
  change the password.
  If says "Success. New password has been set for 0 users."


A new test case in the documentation :class:`ml.users` verifies
this.


Opened new ticket :srcref:`docs/tickets/124` and started to work on it.
Especially in :mod:`ml.households`.

Optimization to the framework in :xfile:`linoweb.js`:
`Lino.ActionPanelForm` now sets the keyboard focus to the first field.

New database field :attr:`ml.households.Member.primary`.
