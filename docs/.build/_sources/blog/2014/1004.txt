Oh no! I had another idea for ticket :srcref:`docs/tickets/122`!

- Configuration will be much simpler when we can simply select the
  whole `body_template` for every :class:`AidType
  <welfare.aids.AidType>`, instead of another template
  `AidType.long_name` stored in the database.

Afterwards I'd now rather say "Oh yes!" because it's better that I saw
this *before* :mod:`welfare.aids` went into production.  It starts to
be beautiful.  I am working on the documentation.  Here is in the new
German user guide for :ref:`welfare`:
