Rien n'est simple
-----------------

:ref:`cosi` failed because it uses
:mod:`lino.modlib.excerpts`
which in turn depends on 
:mod:`ml.outbox`
(which in turn depends on :mod:`ml.uploads`),
but does not install these dependencies.

The test suite failed to reveal this problem because
:ref:`cosi.tested.demo` was not being tested.

:ref:`new`: Thte new attribute :attr:`lino.core.site.Site.needs_plugins` makes it
possible to resolve such dependencies transparently.


A first success for :srcref:`docs/tickets/143` : the
:attr:`dd.AbstractTable.start_at_bottom` option starts to work.  Yes,
this is quite tricky. See the source code.
