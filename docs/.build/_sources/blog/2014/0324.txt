Little change in `shotwell2blog.py`: target root no longer has a
default value, and when no target root is given, it simply prints the
file names. I use this privately to put tagged images into a zip file.

After the week in Chatelet and a few days of rest I'd summarize the
situation as follows:

- We are so close to getting the :ref:`welfare` cake out of my one-man
  studio into "something serious"!

- Lino is so genial! As a framework is is located exactly where
  humanity needs innovative technologies for getting this world
  managed.

- And still there is so much work to do before we can sit back and
  watch it grow by itself!

- But just don't panic. It's as in Matthew 10:16-39.

I added a new section "Open for contribution" in
:srcref:`docs/tickets/index`. The idea is to have a central entry place for
potential new contributors.  Also updated the `Lino Core Developer
<http://saffre-rumma.net/jobs/coredev.html>`_ job announcment.
