===================================


I recently had modified :mod:`ml.beid` to add a new `user_group`. This
change turned out yesterday to cause a regression in :ref:`welcht`:
the "Read eID card" button had disappeared for everybody.


Komiya Takeshi wrote a `survey of Sphinx extensions
<http://sphinxext-survey.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.  This inspired
me to work a bit on :mod:`atelier.sphinxconf`:

- :mod:`atelier.sphinxconf.blog` no longer requires a
  `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` to be defined. This was due to a stupid
  dependency for the `month_name` function.

- moved two directives from :mod:`atelier.sphinxconf.insert_input`
  to a separate module :mod:`atelier.sphinxconf.complex_tables`.

One day I should move them out of :mod:`atelier` into a series of
`sphinx-contrib <https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx-contrib>`_
projects...
