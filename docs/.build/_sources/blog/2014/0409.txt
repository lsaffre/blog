The title of a blog entry
-------------------------

:srcref:`docs/tickets/88`.
Fiddled with the date format in the header of daily blog entries.  It
uses now `babel's
<http://babel.edgewall.org/wiki/Documentation/dates.html>`_ default
"full" format. Which has the advantage of working for blogs in other
languages than English. 

The whole :mod:`atelier.sphinxcontrib` works for me but is usable only
by people who are ready to dive into it. If you want to use it and get
discouraged, don't hesitate to ask for a free consultation before
abandoning completely ;-)



Allgemeine Medizinische Kosten
------------------------------

:srcref:`docs/tickets/93`.  I found a last thing to do before doing an
upgrade of testlino in Eupen: write a demo case of a medical aid
printout.

When application code declared a chooser with an argument for which no
field exists, then Lino made a rather strange error message.  Now it
says more clearly something like Exception: No data element 'foo' in
<class 'lino_welfare.modlib.aids.models.Helper'> (declared in
role_choices)
