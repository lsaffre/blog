And still the unicode error in :mod:`ml.beid` (see :blogref:`20140710`
and :blogref:`20140709`) was not fixed. Next attempt.


Discovered a JS bug: when you fill some new value into a learning
combobox (:ref:`learning_combos`), then you must currently *leave the
field* before submitting the form. That is, you must either click the
"Create" or "Save" button or type TAB and then ENTER. Typing directly
ENTER while still in the combobox will submit the form with an empty
fooHidden field, so Lino will not see your value. Visible for example
in :ref:`faggio` creating an enrolment to a course.

Had a final spurt session on :ref:`faggio`.
Added a filter parameter "room" to :class:`ml.cal.Events`.
