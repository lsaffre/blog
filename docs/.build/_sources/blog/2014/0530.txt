Den Seinen gibt es der Herr im Schlaf (Ps 127,2)
------------------------------------------------

Yesterday I went to sleep with the following problem (for
:srcref:`docs/tickets/106`):

    I didn't yet manage to reproduce this problem.  On a Windows XP
    machine with Java 7u60 everything seems to work perfectly. I don't
    believe that the Windows version makes a difference here.  Okay,
    the most evident difference is that Gerd has Java 7u52.  I have
    7u60 because I missed the intermediate versions and could not find
    a place to download older Java versions.  My next question: Where
    can I get a Windows installer for Java 7u52?

And this morning I understood the explanation:

- I forgot to clear some cache after changing the security settings.

- After doing that, I can confirm that the problem **is**
  reproducible.

- Java 7u52 said only "Signed Applet Blocked by Security Settings",
  but in 7u60 they obviously did dome good work because the message
  has become more useful, now it says:

    Application Blocked by Security Settings.  Your security settings
    have blocked a self-signed applet from running.

And thus the explanation is that I changed the public version of
:ref:`davlink` to be self-signed (not certified).

Updated :srcref:`docs/tickets/106`, opened new ticket :srcref:`docs/tickets/107`.
