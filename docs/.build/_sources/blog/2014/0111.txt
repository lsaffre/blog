====================================

Moved 2 tickets from :ref:`welfare` to :srcref:`docs/tickets/index`. 
Because I realized that

- there must be one central list of tickets

- I'll find a way to make :rst:role:`ddref` work from a central
  doctree: I can write a lino command which writes a file
  `ddmeta.json` which contains all dd names of a project.  As a
  workaround it's possible to use ``:ref:`welfare.pcsw.Client``` to
  get the model's `verbose_name`.

  Moved definition of the :rst:dir:`currentlanguage` directive from
  :mod:`atelier.sphinxconf` to :mod:`lino.utils.actordocs`.
  New directive :rst:dir:`currentproject`.

I admit that my ticket management is still rather poor. 
Still looking for ideas.
