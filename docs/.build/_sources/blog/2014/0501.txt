Sigal
-----

I had the following problem in sigal after upgrade to Ubuntu 14.04::

    INFO: Processing /home/luc/sigal_pictures/pictures/2014/04/27/mvi_6794.avi
    INFO: Processing /home/luc/sigal_pictures/pictures/2014/04/25/img_6755.jpg

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/luc/pythonenvs/py27/bin/sigal", line 9, in <module>
        load_entry_point('sigal==0.6.0', 'console_scripts', 'sigal')()
      File "/home/luc/pythonenvs/py27/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sigal/__init__.py", line 154, in main

        return dispatch(self, *args, **kwargs)
      File "/home/luc/pythonenvs/py27/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/argh/dispatching.py", line 124, in dispatch

        for line in result:
      File "/home/luc/pythonenvs/py27/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/argh/dispatching.py", line 183, in _call
        result = args.function(*positional, **keywords)
      File "/home/luc/pythonenvs/py27/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sigal/__init__.py", line 109, in build
        gal.build()
      File "/home/luc/pythonenvs/py27/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sigal/gallery.py", line 226, in build
        self.pool.map_async(worker, media_list).get(9999)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/multiprocessing/pool.py", line 558, in get
        raise self._value
    OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory

This traceback doesn't show the real culprit because it uses a pool.
The trick was then to use ``sigal build -n 1`` to tell it to not
create a multithreading pool.

The OSError occured during the following code::

    def call_subprocess(cmd):
        """Wrapper to call subprocess.Popen and return stdout & stderr."""
        p = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)


which I changed to::

    def call_subprocess(cmd):
        """Wrapper to call subprocess.Popen and return stdout & stderr."""
        try:
            p = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
        except Exception as e:
            raise e.__class__('Error while running `%s` : %s' % (cmd, e))
    
And the problem finally became unveiled::    

    OSError: Error while running `['ffmpeg', '-i', u'/home/luc/sigal_pictures/pictures/2014/04/27/mvi_6794.avi']` : [Errno 2] No such file or directory

Which then leads to some explanations:

- http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2201230
- https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/UbuntuCompilationGuide

(Since videos aren't that important in my blog, I personally then
chose to remove the blog tag from all videos instead of getting
ffmpeg.)
