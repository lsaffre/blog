====================

I discovered that :class:`lino.modlib.excerpts.CreateExcerpt`, like every
:term:`dialog action`, cannot be in the top toolbar because these
actions must be statically renderable.  This is :srcref:`docs/tickets/105`.

I discovered that Lino didn't yet support choosers on actions with a
parameter window.

- One problem was that :func:`lino.core.actions.check_for_chooser`
  failed when you defined a :meth:`lino.core.actions.Action.FOO_choices` method on an
  action.

- Another problem was that
  `ExtRenderer.js_render_ActionFormPanelSubclass` did not generate a
  :js:func:`ActionFormPanel.before_row_edit` function (and that
  :js:func:`ActionFormPanel.set_field_values` did not call it).

Zwischendurch:

- I started to rename "attestations" to "excerpts". First the model
  classes themselves. The module name will move in a separate commit.

- The Lino test suite had a failure in
  :mod:`lino.tutorials.mini.tests`. Added some test cases there.

- Ich habe mich mal drangesetzt um die Test-Suite von :ref:`welfare`
  wieder ans Laufen zu kriegen. Ist noch nicht ganz fertig.

- :mod:`lino_welfare.tests.test_beid` took more time, but was
  useful because it detected several bugs.
