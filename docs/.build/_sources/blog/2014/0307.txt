Today I am flying to Belgium. Next week I will work in Chatelet to get
the next Lino site up and running.

Worked on how to store the address found on an eid card in the
database.  In :ref:`welfare` this is no longer trivial since the
address from the eid card is not necessarily the client's primary
address (but stored in `pcsw.ClientAdress`).
