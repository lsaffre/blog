Common Knowledge
----------------

Last Friday (:blogref:`20140606`) I wrote about my vision of "using
:ref:`dpy` as data format for maintaining the list of places of a
country". 

During the week-end this vision made another evolution step: I
understood that :ref:`dpy` as data format is too limiting.  The data
format must be plain Python, not some part of Lino or Django.

Today I invested another full day of work in this topic. Starting with
two observations:

- "Paris is the capital of France" is an example of what the Wikipedia
  calls `Common Knowledge
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge>`_.

- The Estonian national statistic institute maintains a "List of
  classificators" (`Klassifikaatorite nimistu
  <http://metaweb.stat.ee/?siteLanguage=ee>`_), and one of them is
  "Classification of Estonian administrative units and settlements"
  (Eesti haldus- ja asustusjaotuse klassifikaator (EHAK).
  Unfortunately this file is not directly useable because it has no
  zip codes.

At the end of the day I had opened three new projects on GitHub:

- `commondata <https://github.com/lsaffre/commondata>`_
- `commondata.be <https://github.com/lsaffre/commondata-be>`_
- `commondata.ee <https://github.com/lsaffre/commondata-ee>`_

TODO: adapt :mod:`lino.modlib.countries.fixtures.ee` and
:mod:`lino.modlib.countries.fixtures.be` to use this data.

See also :mod:`commondata`.
