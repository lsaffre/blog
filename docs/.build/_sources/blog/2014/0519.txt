====================

- New body template for a "plan d'action". The other body templates
  weren't yet converted after the rename "attestations" to "ecerpts".

- Added a :attr:`ml.uploads.Upload.valid_until` to the uploads in
  :mod:`lino_welfare.fixtures.demo` in order to have some tasks in the
  demo database.

- After adding a Task for an Upload (in :ref:`welfare`), the
  `Task.owner` is (correctly) the `Upload`, but `Task.project` doesn't
  point to the `Client`. A Task is a `ProjectRelated`, and it is the
  `project` field which holds that pointer. I removed the field
  `Upload.client` added by :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.uploads` because
  that was redundant with `Upload.project`.


- Cool, the proof of concept passed: `isip.ContractType` and
  `jobs.ContractType` are no longer PrintableType, and `isip.Contract`
  and `jobs.Contract` are no longer Printable. And instead of this,
  there are now two more Excerpt Types, one for each of them.  New
  field `ExcerptType.certifiable`. The field `build_time` is now
  replaced by the virtual field certificate. Certifiable is a mixin
  for models whose instances should have certain fields disabled when
  a "definitive excerpt" (i.e. one with a "certifying" type) has been
  created.

- The same for debts.Budget.

- But the template and bodytemplate in ExcerptType...
