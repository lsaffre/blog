========================

The :class:`ml.outbox.CreateMail` action on a Calendar Event caused a
NameError "global name 'contacts' is not defined". Fixed.

Fixed some stupid but fatal bugs which orrcured when entering
bankstatements.  E.g. AttributeError "'DueMovement' object has no
attribute 'amount'".


Fixed an AttributeError "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'today'"
which occured during bootstrap views of :class:`ml.ledger.Debtors` and
:class:`ml.ledger.Creditors`.
