Finishing on :srcref:`docs/tickets/110`
----------------------------------------

- :mod:`lino_welfare.fixtures.demo` now adds some contract
  partners (:class:`welfare.isip.ContractPartner`).
  Number of partners per contract varies between 0 and 2.

- Started to adapt te `isip/Contact/Default.odt` template and then
  discovered that we have a more recent template in Eupen.

- Upgrade and data migration in Eupen and Chatelet.


Testing for errors in an appy template
--------------------------------------

Added a new test case :srcref:`/tests/test_appy_pod.py` (but then
realized that this test case is in fact always skipped because the
current development version of appy `has no `setup.py` file
<https://bugs.launchpad.net/appy/+bug/1048963>`_ and thus cannot be
installed using pip; the PYTHONPATH seems to be ignored with `setup.py
test`).
