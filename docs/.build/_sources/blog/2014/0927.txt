Oops, the main Lino web server was offline for some hours this morning
after an upgrade from `Squeeze
<https://www.debian.org/releases/squeeze/>`_ to `Wheezy
<https://www.debian.org/releases/wheezy/>`_.

A good news: We have now two shortcut subdomains pointing to the most
viewed parts of this website:

- `demo.lino-framework.org <http://demo.lino-framework.org>`_
- `blog.lino-framework.org <http://blog.lino-framework.org>`_
