The Django volunteers are quick.
Yesterday I created `my first Django ticket <http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/10431>`__, 
and it didn't last half an
hour before somebody answered. 

The answer wasn't long: It just said
"Dupe of `#8164 <http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/8164>`_".

Yes, I didn't look at the SortedDict class.
And this solution of just setting `SortedDict.keyOrder`
is better and simpler than my method.

But where is this update? The patch is marked "Accepted", 
but is not yet in the trunk.  How can I now get it?
Answer:

- Download the patch from  http://code.djangoproject.com/attachment/ticket/8164/modelforms-fields-order.diff

- Then in a command shell::

    L:\snapshot\django>patch < c:\temp\modelforms-fields-order.diff
    can't find file to patch at input line 5
    Perhaps you should have used the -p or --strip option?
    The text leading up to this was:
    --------------------------
    |diff --git a/django/forms/models.py b/django/forms/models.py
    |index e6bbb98..d5eab82 100644
    |--- a/django/forms/models.py
    |+++ b/django/forms/models.py
    --------------------------
    File to patch:
    L:\snapshot\django>cd trunk
    The system cannot find the path specified.

    L:\snapshot\django>patch -p1 < c:\temp\modelforms-fields-order.diff
    patching file django/forms/models.py
    patching file docs/topics/forms/modelforms.txt
    patching file tests/modeltests/model_forms/models.py
