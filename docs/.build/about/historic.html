<h1>Historic notes<a class="headerlink" href="#historic-notes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>My computer career started at the age of 14. Between 1982 and 1987 I
passed some of my spare time by writing simple BASIC programs on a
TRS-80. I discovered this hobby because I attended to a one-week
programming camp in 1982. My father was at this time the proud
possessor of a Tandy TRS-80 with 64 KB of RAM and a graphics
resolution of 127 x 64 black and white pixels.</p>
<p>Before becoming a programmer, I studied Biology at the University of
Namur (French-speaking part of Belgium), during two years from
September 1986 to September 1988. Although I abandoned these
studies, I think that these two years were not lost for me. They had
a deep contribution on how I look at our world. I am most thankful
to J.L. De Sloover for his teachings.</p>
<p>After my studies I worked at Siemens-Nixdorf in Liège for 18 months
(from September 1990 to January 1992). I got in touch with the
operating systems UNIX and BS/2000. One of my projects was for
example a parser who read a database definition file and generated a
PostScript file that visualized entity/relations diagrams of the
database.</p>
<p>In December 1992 I resigned at Siemens-Nixdorf because I had decided
to change my vocation: I wanted to become a primary school teacher.
Although programmer was a beautiful and secure job, I was not
fascinated by what I was doing. In Belgium it is theoretically
possible to make a diplome by learning on your own and passing a state
exam (&#8220;Jury central&#8221;). I applied for acceptance to this exam.  While
waiting for an answer from the government I started a half-time job as
programmer at PAC Systems in Eupen (January 1992).  Half a year later
I received the answer of the government: I was the only person asking
for a state exam as primary school teacher, and they would not
organize such an exam for me alone. This answer was not so
disappointing to me because meanwhile I was enjoying my new job very
much. I switched to full-time on September 1st, 1992. PAC Systems was
at this time a company with three employees. Now there are 5 employees
and three trainees.</p>
<p>During the next 8 years I worked at PAC Systems (renamed to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.abakus.be">AbAKUS</a>
in 2008) as software designer and programmer.  I developed <a class="reference external" href="http://tim.saffre-rumma.net/129.html">TIM</a>, a
customizable software application for small and medium-sized
companies, used for invoicing, accountance, stock management, etc. TIM
is written in <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_(programming_language)">Clipper</a> (now compiled using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.alaska-software.com/products/xpp/xpp.shtm">Alaska xBase++</a>) and runs on
MS-DOS.  Besides software development I also gave hotline and
technical support for our customers.  Besides working on TIM I gave
computer lessons about Office software (MS Word, Excel, Access) to
end-users in our training center or at the customers&#8217; offices.</p>
<p>In 1995 I started to work on a &#8220;TIM for Windows&#8221;, using <em>Borland C++</em>.</p>
<p>In March 1999 I switched to <em>Java</em>.</p>
<p>In August 2000 I announced to my employer that I decided to move to
Estonia.  I promised them to stay another year so that they have a
chance to find a successor for me.  I passed the
&#8220;Ausbilder-Eignungsprüfung&#8221; in Aachen (Germany) and became responsible
for the training of a 19-year-old future software application
developer (IT-Fachmann, Fachrichtung Anwendungsentwicklung).</p>
<p>After my moving to Estonia in August 2001 I started a <em>sabbatical
year</em>: continued the Java port project on my own and without getting
money for it.  I once tried a <em>PHP</em> port that got quite far but is now
forgotten.</p>
<p>In 2002 I abandoned C++, Java and PHP without tears after discovering
the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> programming language.  In September 2008 I started to use
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>.  In August 2009 I started to use <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/">ExtJS</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Where is the songbook project? Where is your private blog?</strong></p>
<p>One of my projects is dead. It was called <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/songbook/1.0.0">songbook</a> and was a tool to
manage song collections and generate printable <cite>.pdf</cite> files with and
without scores in different sizes.  We used it to print the Estonian
version of the Taizé songs (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.taize.fr/en_article957.html?territ=27&amp;category=1&amp;lang=et">Taizé laulud</a>).
The project was designed to be of general use also for others, so the
code repository contained some example files, one of which contained
texts of over 200 German songs.  Some of these songs had an empty
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">author</span></code> field, but I didn&#8217;t care much about copyright questions
because this file was a plain text markup format and not directly
printable. I just added a remark &#8220;It is not allowed to use this
document for anything else than learning how the <em>songbook</em> module
works.  Before publishing this document or parts of it, you would need
to check with the copyright holders of the individual songs.&#8221;  And
four of these songs were written by a German songwriter.  The author
discovered them, and he <em>did</em> care about copyright, and in august 2012
he asked me to pay a license fee of 630€.  Even though I removed the
whole project immediately and convinced him that I was not doing any
business with &#8220;his&#8221; &#8220;property&#8221;.  Oh my god.  And it seems that this
was still a rather cheap price for a sin against copyright.  I paid it
because I knew that the costs would become even worse if that guy
decided to go to court.  I then noticed that my private blog contained
probably other similar sins against copyright. So I removed it before
getting more invoices for license fees.</p>
