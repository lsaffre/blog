I am patiently looking for my future boss and employer.
Yes, I am a job seeker. A job seeker with special conditions.

I am the author and maintainer of the :ref:`Lino framework <lf>`. I have been
working on this vision my whole life.
My future employer needs to convince me that they will continue collaborating
with our existing customers and employees. They will have to take over
:ref:`rumma` and bring the :ref:`Lino framework <lf>` to the next level.

It is possible that there is something better than Lino and that Lino can be
replaced by some other product. I am open to consider this. And I would
eventually repent and, together, we would migrate existing Lino users to your
product.  But note that I will not collaborate in any proprietary software
product. I will rather grow potatoes than write non-free software.

I guess that my future employer is unlikely to be a :term:`private corporation`.
It will rather be a non-profit organization, a foundation, a cooperative or a
public service. That's because the :ref:`Lino framework <lf>` is published under the
*GNU Affero General Public License* (AGPL), the most :term:`protective Free
Software license` there is. You cannot write :term:`proprietary software` using
Lino. (See :ref:`lino.copyright`).



Here is my self-presentation:

- Developer skills: Linux, Python, Django, Sphinx, Git, React.

- Besides being a full-heart software developer I have long-term experience in
  accounting, team management, mentoring, sales agreements, website authoring.
  After all I am also CEO and one of the two owners of
  :ref:`rumma`. I started employing other developers in 2015 (see `our team page
  <https://www.saffre-rumma.net/team/>`__).
