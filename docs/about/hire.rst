Hire me

I am a job seeker.
I am looking for my future boss and employer.
Here is my self-presentation:

- Developer skills: Linux, Python, Django, Sphinx, Git, React.

- Besides being a full-heart software developer I have long-term experience in
  accounting, team management, mentoring, sales agreements, website authoring.
  I started employing other developers in 2015 (see `our team page
  <https://www.saffre-rumma.net/team/>`__).

- Preferred locations are Estonia and Belgium.  Other countries are possible
  with a reasonable regulation regarding remote work.

- See also :doc:`index`.

I have two special conditions:

- My future employer must let me continue to support our existing customers. I
  would help migrating them to your product if your product is better than Lino,
  but probably you will just continue my existing service level agreements with
  them.

- I am not available for working on :term:`proprietary software`. I believe that
  :ref:`software must be free <ss.free>`. I have spent my whole life showing
  that software business is possible without using proprietary licenses. I use
  to say that `I will rather grow potatoes than write non-free software
  <https://hw.saffre-rumma.net/me/#i-will-rather-grow-potatoes-than-write-non-free-software>`__.
  After all I am also CEO and one of the owners of `Rumma & Ko OÃœ
  <https://www.saffre-rumma.net/>`__, which feeds 2.5 families by selling our
  services as the maintainer of :term:`sustainably free software`.

..
  I guess that my future employer is unlikely to be a :term:`private corporation`.
  It will rather be a non-profit organization, a foundation, or a public service.
