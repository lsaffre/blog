Hire me

I am patiently looking for my future boss and employer.
I am a job seeker with special conditions.

My preferred locations are Estonia and Belgium.  Other countries are possible
with a reasonable regulation regarding remote work.

I am the author and maintainer of the :ref:`Lino framework <lf>`. I have been
working on this vision my whole life. My future employer needs to convince me
that they will continue collaborating with our existing customers and employees
and bring the :ref:`Lino framework <lf>` to the next level.

I will not collaborate in any *proprietary* software product.
The :ref:`Lino framework <lf>` is published under the *GNU Affero General Public
License* (AGPL), the most :term:`protective Free Software license` there is. You
cannot write :term:`proprietary software` using Lino.
(See :ref:`Introducing Free Software <ss.free>`).

If you use some other free software product that is better than Lino,
I am open to consider replacing Lino by it and help you to
migrate existing Lino users to your product.

I guess that my future employer is unlikely to be a :term:`private corporation`.
It will rather be a non-profit organization, a foundation, a cooperative or a
public service.


Here is my self-presentation:

- Developer skills: Linux, Python, Django, Sphinx, Git, React.

- Besides being a full-heart software developer I have long-term experience in
  accounting, team management, mentoring, sales agreements, website authoring.
  After all I am also CEO and one of the two owners of
  :ref:`rumma`. I started employing other developers in 2015 (see `our team page
  <https://www.saffre-rumma.net/team/>`__).
