I am a job seeker.
I am patiently looking for my future boss and employer.

Here is my self-presentation:

- Developer skills: Linux, Python, Django, Sphinx, Git, React.

- My preferred locations are Estonia and Belgium.  Other countries are possible
  with a reasonable regulation regarding remote work.

- Besides being a full-heart software developer I have long-term experience in
  accounting, team management, mentoring, sales agreements, website authoring.
  After all I am also CEO and one of the two owners of
  :ref:`rumma`. I started employing other developers in 2015 (see `our team page
  <https://www.saffre-rumma.net/team/>`__).

- See also :doc:`index`.

But I have a special condition:  I fundamentally believe that :ref:`software
must be free <ss.free>`;  My company `Rumma & Ko OÃœ
<https://www.saffre-rumma.net/>`__ is a proof that professional software
business is possible without using proprietary licenses. We live from selling
our services as the maintainer of the :ref:`Lino framework <lf>`. Lino is
published under the *GNU Affero General Public License* (AGPL), the most
:term:`protective Free Software license` there is. I have been working this way
for more than twenty years, I am not going to stop it. "I will rather grow
potatoes than write non-free software", as I `use to say
<https://hw.saffre-rumma.net/me/#i-will-rather-grow-potatoes-than-write-non-free-software>`__.
So I am unfortunately not available for working on any :term:`proprietary
software` product.

My future employer must somehow let me continue to support our existing
customers. If you know a free software product that is better than Lino, I am
open to consider migrating our customers to your product.

..
  I guess that my future employer is unlikely to be a :term:`private corporation`.
  It will rather be a non-profit organization, a foundation, or a public service.
