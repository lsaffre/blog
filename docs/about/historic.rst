Historic notes
==============

My computer career started in **1982** when I was 14 after attending
to a one-week programming camp.  Between 1982 and 1987 I passed some
of my spare time by writing simple BASIC programs on a TRS-80. My
father was at this time the proud possessor of a `Tandy TRS-80
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80>`_ with 64 KB of RAM and a
graphics resolution of 127 x 64 black and white pixels.

Before becoming a programmer, I studied Biology at the University of 
Namur (French-speaking part of Belgium), during two years from 
September 1986 to September 1988. Although I abandoned these 
studies, I think that these two years were not lost for me. They had 
a deep contribution on how I look at our world. I am most thankful 
to J.L. De Sloover for his teachings.

In **June 1990** I finished my studies of Gradué en informatique.

After my studies I worked at Siemens-Nixdorf in Liège for 18 months
(from September **1990** to January **1992**). I got in touch with the
operating systems UNIX and BS/2000. One of my projects was for example
a parser who read a database definition file and generated a
PostScript file that visualized entity/relations diagrams of the
database.

In **December 1992** I resigned at Siemens-Nixdorf because I had
decided to change my vocation: I wanted to become a primary school
teacher.  Although programmer was a beautiful and secure job, I was
not fascinated by what I was doing. In Belgium it is theoretically
possible to make a diplome by learning on your own and passing a state
exam ("Jury central"). I applied for acceptance to this exam.  While
waiting for an answer from the government I started a half-time job as
programmer at PAC Systems in Eupen (January 1992).  Half a year later
I received the answer of the government: I was the only person asking
for a state exam as primary school teacher, and they would not
organize such an exam for me alone. This answer was not so
disappointing to me because meanwhile I was enjoying my new job very
much. I switched to full-time on September 1st, 1992. PAC Systems was
at this time a company with three employees. Now there are 5 employees
and three trainees.

During the next 8 years I worked at PAC Systems (renamed to AbAKUS_
in 2008) as software designer and programmer.  I developed TIM_, a
customizable software application for small and medium-sized
companies, used for invoicing, accountance, stock management, etc. TIM
is written in Clipper_ (now compiled using `Alaska xBase++
<http://www.alaska-software.com/products/xpp/xpp.shtm>`_) and runs on
MS-DOS.  Besides software development I also gave hotline and
technical support for our customers.  Besides working on TIM I gave
computer lessons about Office software (MS Word, Excel, Access) to
end-users in our training center or at the customers' offices.

In **1995** I started to work on a "TIM for Windows", using *Borland
C++*. In **March 1999** I switched to *Java*.

In **August 1998** I met my future wife for the first time in Taizé,
in **January 1999** I met her again in Milano.  In **April 1999** we
met for the third time for three days in Eupen and I fell seriously in
love with her. In **June** we met the fourth time in Tallinn. (...)

In **February 1999** I passed the "Ausbilder-Eignungsprüfung" in
Aachen (Germany) and became responsible for the training of a
19-year-old future software application developer (IT-Fachmann,
Fachrichtung Anwendungsentwicklung).

In **August 2000** I announced to my employer that I decided to move
to Estonia.  I agreed to stay another year so that they have a chance
to find a successor for me.

In **October 2000** I married.

In **August 2001** I moved to Estonia where I started a *sabbatical
year*: continued the Java port project on my own and without getting
money for it.  I once tried a *PHP* port that got quite far but is now
forgotten.

In **August 2002** I announced to the TIM users in Eastern Belgium
that I would continue to maintain and give support for TIM, but at new
conditions, requiring a yearly fee.

In **2002** I discovered the Python_ programming language and
abandoned C++, Java and PHP without tears.

When I discovered Django_ in the end of **2008**, after having worked
many months on my own database model, I was quickly fascinated.  The
ORM and database model based on 'apps' is simply genial.  The way of
how this is integrated into a web application server system: genial.
But a few things disturbed me with Django, and I felt that I need to
change them before I can be satisfied.  That's why I started to write
Lino.  After some search for a valuable user interface, I started to
use ExtJS_ in **August 2009**.


**Where is the songbook project? Where is your private blog?**

One of my projects is dead. It was called `songbook
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/songbook/1.0.0>`_ and was a tool to
manage song collections and generate printable `.pdf` files with and
without scores in different sizes.  We used it to print the Estonian
version of the Taizé songs (`Taizé laulud
<http://www.taize.fr/en_article957.html?territ=27&category=1&lang=et>`_).
The project was designed to be of general use also for others, so the
code repository contained some example files, one of which contained
texts of over 200 German songs.  Some of these songs had an empty
``author`` field, but I didn't care much about copyright questions
because this file was a plain text markup format and not directly
printable. I just added a remark "It is not allowed to use this
document for anything else than learning how the *songbook* module
works.  Before publishing this document or parts of it, you would need
to check with the copyright holders of the individual songs."  And
four of these songs were written by a German songwriter.  The author
discovered them, and he *did* care about copyright, and in august 2012
he asked me to pay a license fee of 630€.  Even though I removed the
whole project immediately and convinced him that I was not doing any
business with "his" "property".  Oh my god.  And it seems that this
was still a rather cheap price for a sin against copyright.  I paid it
because I knew that the costs would become even worse if that guy
decided to go to court.  I then noticed that my private blog contained
probably other similar sins against copyright. So I removed it before
getting more invoices for license fees.
