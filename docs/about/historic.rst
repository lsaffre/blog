Historic notes
==============

My computer career started in **1982** when I was 14 after attending
to a one-week programming camp.  Between 1982 and 1987 I passed some
of my spare time by writing simple BASIC programs on a TRS-80. My
father was at this time the proud possessor of a `Tandy TRS-80
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80>`_ with 64 KB of RAM and a
graphics resolution of 127 x 64 black and white pixels.

Before becoming a programmer, I studied Biology at the University of
Namur (French-speaking part of Belgium), during two years from
September 1986 to September 1988. Although I abandoned these
studies, I think that these two years were not lost for me. They had
a deep contribution on how I look at our world. I am most thankful
to J.L. De Sloover for his teachings.

In **June 1990** I finished my studies of Gradué en informatique.

After my studies I worked at Siemens-Nixdorf in Liège for 18 months
(from September **1990** to January **1992**). I got in touch with the
operating systems UNIX and BS/2000. One of my projects was for example
a parser who read a database definition file and generated a
PostScript file that visualized entity/relations diagrams of the
database.

In **December 1992** I resigned at Siemens-Nixdorf because I had decided to
change my vocation: I wanted to become a primary school teacher.  Although
programmer was a beautiful and secure job, I was not fascinated by what I was
doing. In Belgium it is theoretically possible to make a diplome by learning on
your own and passing a state exam ("Jury central"). I applied for acceptance to
this exam.  While waiting for an answer from the government I started a
half-time job as programmer at PAC Systems in Eupen (January 1992).  Half a year
later I received the answer of the government: I was the only person asking for
a state exam as primary school teacher, and they would not organize such an exam
for me alone. This answer was not so disappointing to me because meanwhile I was
enjoying my new job very much. I switched to full-time on September 1st, 1992.
PAC Systems was at this time a company with three employees.

During the next 8 years I worked at PAC Systems (renamed to AbAKUS_ in 2008) as
software developer and programmer.  I developed TIM_, a customizable software
application for small and medium-sized companies, used for invoicing,
accounting, warehouse management, etc. TIM is written in Clipper_ (now compiled
using `Alaska xBase++`_) and runs only on Windows.  Besides writing software  I
also gave hotline and technical support for our customers.  Besides working on
TIM I gave computer lessons about Office software (MS Word, Excel, Access) to
end-users in our training center or at the customers' offices.

In **1995** I started to work on a "TIM for Windows", using *Borland
C++*. In **March 1999** I switched to *Java*.

In **August 1998** I met my future wife for the first time in Taizé, in
**January 1999** a second time in Milano.  In **April 1999** we met for the
third time for three days in Eupen and I fell seriously in love with her. In
**June** we met the fourth time in Tallinn. (...)

In **February 1999** I passed the "Ausbilder-Eignungsprüfung" in Aachen
(Germany) and became responsible for the training of a 19-year-old future
software application developer (IT-Fachmann, Fachrichtung
Anwendungsentwicklung).

In **August 2000** I announced to my employer that I decided to move to Estonia.
I agreed to stay another year so that they have a chance to find a successor for
me.

In **October 2000** I married.

In **August 2001** I moved to Estonia where I started a *sabbatical year*:
continued the Java port project on my own and without getting money for it.  I
once tried a *PHP* port that got quite far but is now forgotten.

In **August 2002** I announced to the TIM users in Belgium that I would continue
to maintain and give support for TIM, but at new conditions, requiring a yearly
fee. About half of the users joined the project, which was enough to provide a
decent salary.  My vision received a financially sustainable base.

In **2002** I discovered the Python_ programming language and abandoned C++,
Java and PHP without tears. My first Python product is called `TIM Tools
<https://github.com/lsaffre/timtools>`__ and is used by others since December
2002.

In the end of **2008**, after having worked many months on my own database
model, I  discovered Django_ and was quickly fascinated.  Django's ORM and
database model are simply genial.  The way of how this is integrated into a web
application server system: genial. But  `a few things
<https://dev.lino-framework.org/dev/about/lino_and_django.html>`__ disturbed me
with Django, and I felt that I need to change them before I can be satisfied.
That's why I started to write Lino.  After some search for a valuable user
interface, I started to use ExtJS_ in **August 2009**.
