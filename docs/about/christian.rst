===================
I am a Christian...
===================

Yes, I declare publicly that I am a Christian. But let me explain what
that means to me.  And don't expect a short answer.

The meaning of life
===================

What is the meaning of life? Well, the *scientific* answer to that
question is 42, as Douglas Adams describes in the Hitchhiker's Guide
to the Galaxy. But the problem is the question, not the answer.

We ask about the meaning of our life, whether it makes sense to live,
but that question is absurd, because any system has a "meaning"
(purpose, sense) only *for some other system* which looks at it from
the outside. Some time ago it was possible to ask whether a given
slave had a meaning or not. Because I am a free person, my life makes
sense only if humanity as a whole makes sense. And humanity as a whole
makes sense only if the Universe makes sense. Life, the Universe and
everything makes sense only if there is some world beyond the visible
world.

This hypothetical world must be invisible to us, not detectable by any
scientific method.  It has neither a clear definition nor a name
because it is bigger than anything we can conceive, because *by
definition* it lies beyond our thinking.

All religious systems use different concepts to do basically the same
thing: they assume such a world outside the visible universe which
gives a meaning to it.

Unfortunately you must now either continue reading `in German

find time to translate it.
