I am a Christian
================

Yes, I confess publicly that I am a Christian. But let me explain what
that means to me. Don't expect a short answer.

The meaning of life
===================

What it the meaning of life? Well, the *scientific* answer to that
question is 42, as Douglas Adams describes in the Hitchhiker's Guide
to the Galaxy. But he adds that the problem is the question, not the
answer.

We ask about the meaning of our life, whether it makes sense to live,
but that question is absurd, because any system has a "meaning"
(purpose, sense) only *for some other system* which looks at it from
the outside. Some time ago it was possible to ask whether a given
slave had a meaning or not. Because I am a free person, my life makes
sense only if humanity as a whole makes sense. And humanity as a whole
makes sense only if the Universe makes sense. All this makes sense
only if there is some world beyond the Universe.

This hypothetical world must be invisible to us, not detectable by any
scientific method. Otherwise we would have discovered and explored it
long ago.

We can call that hypothetical world "Heaven" and "Kingdom of God" as
the Christians do, or we can imagine a "Mother Earth" acting as a
goddess, we can fit this into any religious teaching. The important
thing to remember here is that it is a *hypothese*.  We don't *know*
it.

We really don't know
====================

There is one religion which does not accept above hypothese, namely
the atheistic faith.
