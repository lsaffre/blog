I am an independent software developer, providing my customers with
**customized database applications**. All my software projects are
published as **free software**.

I was born and grew up in `Eupen
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eupen>`_ in Belgium.  At the age of 30 I
met an Estonian woman, we married, I moved to Estonia and hope to die
there (not too soon).  We have 2 daughters and live in a small
village.  We both work for our self-owned family company `Rumma & Ko
