I was born and grew up in `Eupen
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eupen>`_ in Belgium.  At the age of 30 I
met an Estonian woman, we married, I moved to Estonia and hope to die
there (not too soon).  We have 2 daughters and live in a small
village.  We both work for our self-owned family company `Rumma & Ko
OÜ <http://www.saffre-rumma.net/>`_.

Personal preferences
--------------------

- I prefer using Free Software whenever possible.
  I encourage people around me to do the same.

- I prefer getting complete understanding of problems over 
  finding quick solutions.

- I prefer using my creativity over copying solutions of other 
  people.

- I am more fascinated by humans than by computers: how they learn,
  how they organize themselves. I enjoy communicating with end-users
  in order to optimize their work methods.

- I prefer doing the first 20% of a job which return `80% of the final
  result <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle>`__.

Hobbies
-------

- I enjoy singing alone and with others. I have a more than average
  musical education but did never consider becoming a professional.

- I was a motivated Scout leader between September 1986 and July 1994. 
  After these 8 years I continued during several years to organize 
  trainings for young scout leaders.

Personal views
--------------

- I grew up in a catholic family, and since I live in Vigala am
  engaged in the local lutheran `church community
  <http://www.eelk.ee/vigala/>`_.  My faith has been influenced by the
  spirituality of the `Taizé <http://taize.fr/>`_ community.  

- I haven't watched television (other than occasionally) since
  about 1990.

- I am not actively engaged in any political direction, but people
  tend to classify me as green. I believe that finding ways for global
  sustainable development is more important than keeping the consumer
  society running.  If given the choice between a climate catastrophe
  and a world-wide economic crisis, I'd chose the latter.  We need new
  sociological methods in order to become really democratic.
