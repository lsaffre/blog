Personal preferences
--------------------

- I prefer using Free Software whenever
  possible and encourage people around me to do the same.

- I prefer getting complete understanding of problems over
  finding quick solutions.

- I prefer using my creativity over copying solutions of other
  people.

- I am more fascinated by humans than by computers: how they learn,
  how they organize themselves. I enjoy communicating with end-users
  in order to optimize their work methods.

- I prefer doing the first 20% of a job that return `80% of the final
  result <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle>`__.

- I haven't watched television other than occasionally since
  about 1990.

Hobbies
-------

- I enjoy singing alone and with others. I have a more than average
  musical education but did never consider becoming a professional.

- In my spare time I happen to write on personal websites like
  `Human World <https://hw.saffre-rumma.net/>`__ or
  `Eesti Taizé Sõbrad <https://www.laudate.ee/>`__.

- I sporadically work for Wikipedia, mostly in `Estonian
  <https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasutaja:LucSaffre>`__ because I live
  in Estonia, sometimes in `German
  <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benutzer:LucSaffre>`__ because
  that's my mother language.

- I was a motivated Scout leader between September 1986 and July 1994.
  After these 8 years I continued during several years to organize
  trainings for young scout leaders. The `FSC
  <https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Scouts_-_F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_des_Scouts_Baden-Powell_de_Belgique>`__
  honored my work by assigning me the `Wood Badge
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_Badge>`__ award.

- Before getting married I lived 3 years in a volunteer project community of the
  `Ephata <https://www.ephata.be/>`__ youth center in Eupen, followed by 3 years
  in a private community with my sister and her husband.
