TIM and Lino
------------

My main projects are Lino_ (a framework for writing desktop-like web
applications using Django and ExtJS) and TIM_ (a customizable database
application that runs on 60 sites in Belgium).  Lino is the successor
for TIM.

All my software projects are published as free software, using GPL,
LGPL or BSD.

Other projects:

- atelier_, eidreader_ and davlink_ are independant projects released
  under the BSD instead of LGPL.

- `Lino Welfare <http://welfare.lino-framework.org>`__,
  `Lino Patrols <http://patrols.lino-framework.org>`__,
  `Lino Faggio <http://faggio.lino-framework.org>`__ and
  `Lino Cosi <http://cosi.lino-framework.org>`__
  are Lino *applications*, released as free software. 

- TIMtools_ -- A suite of win32 command-line tools for TIM_.

Personal characteristics
------------------------

- I prefer using Free Software whenever possible.
  I encourage people around me to do the same.

- I prefer using my creativity over copying solutions of other 
  people. I prefer getting complete understanding of problems over 
  finding quick solutions.

- I am not only fascinated by computers but also by humans: how they
  learn, how they organize themselves. I usually enjoy to communicate
  with end-users in order to optimize their work methods.

- I enjoy singing alone and with others. I have a more than average
  musical education but did never consider becoming a professional.

- I haven't watched television (other than occasionally) since
  about 1990.

- I was a motivated Scout leader between September 1986 and July 1994. 
  After these 8 years I continued during several years to organize 
  trainings for young scout leaders.

Personal views
--------------

- I grew up in a catholic family, and since I live in Vigala am
  engaged in the local lutheran `church community
  <http://www.eelk.ee/vigala/>`_.  My faith has been influenced by the
  spirituality of the `Taizé <http://taize.fr/>`_ community.  

- I am not actively engaged in any political direction, but people
  tend to classify me as green. I believe that finding ways for global
  sustainable development is more important than keeping the consumer
  society running.  If given the choice between a climate catastrophe
  and a world-wide economic crisis, I'd chose the latter.  We need new
  sociological methods in order to become really democratic.
