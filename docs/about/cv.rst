Personal preferences
--------------------

- I prefer using :doc:`Free Software </topics/whyfree/index>` whenever
  possible and encourage people around me to do the same.

- I prefer getting complete understanding of problems over 
  finding quick solutions.

- I prefer using my creativity over copying solutions of other 
  people.

- I am more fascinated by humans than by computers: how they learn,
  how they organize themselves. I enjoy communicating with end-users
  in order to optimize their work methods.

- I prefer doing the first 20% of a job which return `80% of the final
  result <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle>`__.

- I haven't watched television other than occasionally since
  about 1990.

Hobbies
-------

- I enjoy singing alone and with others. I have a more than average
  musical education but did never consider becoming a professional.

- I sporadically work for Wikipedia, mostly in `Estonian
  <https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasutaja:LucSaffre>`__ because I live
  there, sometimes in `German
  <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benutzer:LucSaffre>`__ because
  that's my mother language.
  
- I was a motivated Scout leader between September 1986 and July 1994.
  After these 8 years I continued during several years to organize
  trainings for young scout leaders. The `FSC
  <https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Scouts_-_F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_des_Scouts_Baden-Powell_de_Belgique>`__
  honored my work by assigning me the `Wood Badge
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_Badge>`__ award.

Personal views
--------------

- I grew up in a catholic family, and after moving to Vigala engaged
  in the local lutheran `church community
  <http://www.eelk.ee/vigala/>`_.  My faith has been influenced by the
  spirituality of the `Taizé <http://taize.fr/>`_ community.

- I am not actively engaged in any political party. The
  politicalcompass.org website classified me as `Economically rather
  Left and Socially moderatedly Libertarian
  <https://www.politicalcompass.org/analysis2?ec=-8.63&soc=-4.26>`__. I
  believe that finding ways for global sustainable development is more
  important than keeping the consumer society running.  If given the
  choice between a a world-wide economic crisis and climate
  catastrophe, I'd chose the former.  We need new sociological methods
  in order to become rule this world.
