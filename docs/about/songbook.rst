Where is the songbook project?
==============================

One of my projects is dead. It was called `songbook
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/songbook/1.0.0>`_ and was a tool to
manage song collections and generate printable `.pdf` files with and
without scores in different sizes.  We used it to print the Estonian
version of the Taizé songs (`Taizé laulud
<http://www.taize.fr/en_article957.html?territ=27&category=1&lang=et>`_).

The project was designed to be of general use also for others, so the
code repository contained some example files.

One of these examples contained texts of over 200 German songs. Spiritual songs
that we used for prayer and worship in my home town.  My long-term plan was to
eventually produce a new songbook for our congregation.  Some of the songs in my
examples had an empty ``author`` field, but I didn't feel responsible about
copyright questions because this file was a plain text markup format and not
directly printable. I knew already that copyright would be an issue and added a
remark "It is not allowed to use this document for anything else than learning
how the *songbook* module works. Before publishing this document or parts of it,
you would need to check with the copyright holders of the individual songs."

But that wasn't enough, as it turned out. Four of these songs were written by a
German songwriter.  The author discovered them, and he *did* care about
copyright, and in August 2012 he asked me to pay a license fee of 630€. Even
though I removed the whole project immediately and convinced him that I was not
doing any business with "his" "property".  Oh my god.

And it seems that this was still a rather cheap price for a sin against
copyright.  I paid it because I knew that the costs would become even worse if
that guy decided to go to court.

Shortly after this I realized that my private blog contained probably other
similar sins against copyright. So I removed it before getting more invoices for
license fees.

Later I restarted blogging, because this is my way of communicating, but 14
years of content (from 1998 to 2012) are visible only to me because I didn't yet
have time to make it copyright-compliant.

One can say that this was a key experience in my life and one of the reasons why
I started the `Lutsu project <https://hw.saffre-rumma.net/lutsu/>`__.
