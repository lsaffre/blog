Welcome to my developer blog. This is where I write about my work as a software
developer, especially for the `Synodalsoft project
<https://www.synodalsoft.net/>`__. In 2015 we started using `Jane
<https://jane.mylino.net>`__ as our communication platform and since then  this
blog has become less important for me.
