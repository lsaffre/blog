My answer to this is yes, choosing free software *does* make our life
more complicated, and yes, we need to find trustworthy *partners*
because we cannot do everything ourselves, but no, our `sovereignity
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty>`_ at the software level
*is* necessary and worth the effort.


For the brave
=============

Choosing free software is actually *not* difficult. But most people
*believe* that it is. Which becomes a `self-fulfilling prophecy
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy>`_ causing
miscellaneous problems.  Here are some examples of the challenges you
are going to face if you decide for free software:

- Psychological effects ("Under Windows it would work better") ranging
  from personal reproaches for your decision to measurable
  side-effects.

- Using free software means that it is more difficult to get trained
  human resources, professional support, specialized hardware.

- The end-users themselves are reluctant to change their habits
  because they use proprietary software at home.

You will need to consider these challenges and decide bravely how to
react to them.  You will need measurable additional effort because you
are leaving the mainstream.


An International Data Agency
============================

Jens Berger suggests an International Data Agency, and organization
with universal authority who distributes the profit gained by the
companies who turn data into money.
