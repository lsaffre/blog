It is about power

Free software is not about **money** and not about **comfortability**,
it is about **power**.

The real issue with proprietary software is that its copyright holder
inevitably tries to gain power over its users.  Vendors of proprietary
software are skillful in finding ever and ever new tricks and whole
technologies whose ultimate goal is to bind you to their product
(`vendor lock-in <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in>`_).
They hide this fact more or less successfully, but it is a necessary
part of the game.

If you care about the sovereignty and liberty of the information
systems in your enterprise or organization, you ask questions like the
following:

- Who will help us when something goes wrong? Who is responsible for
  maintaining that software, for giving support to its end-users?

- How sustainable is my investment?  Who is going to decide whether to
  switch to some newer technology?  Or to discontinue some existing
  product and push us to migrate to a newer one?

- Who is going to analyze our needs, decide how to cope with new
  challenges, which new functionalities should be implemented and
  which not?

- How competent is that organization? What is their motivation? How is
  the price-quality ratio? Do they have concurrents?  Are they being
  regulated by the free market? Do I have a possibility to chose
  another partner in case I am not satisfied?
