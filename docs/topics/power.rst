It is about power

Free software is not about **money** and not about **comfortability**,
it is about **power**.

The real issue with proprietary software is that its copyright holder
inevitably tries to gain power over its users.  Vendors of proprietary
software are skillful in finding ever and ever new tricks and whole
technologies whose ultimate goal is to bind you to their product
(`vendor lock-in <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in>`_).
They hide this fact more or less successfully, but it is a necessary
part of the game.

    "[O]ne of the many major problems with governing people is that of
    whom you get to do it; or rather of who manages to get people to
    let them do it to them.  To summarize: It is a well known fact
    that those people who most want to rule people are, ipso facto,
    those least suited to do it. To summarize the summary: anyone who
    is capable of getting themselves made President should on no
    account be allowed to do the job."
    -- Douglas Adams, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe

If you care about the sovereignty and liberty of the information
systems in your enterprise or organization, then you ask questions
like the following:

- Who will help us when something goes wrong? Who is responsible for
  maintaining that software, for giving support to its end-users?

- Who is going to decide whether to switch to some newer technology?
  Or to discontinue some existing product and push us to migrate to a
  newer one?

- Who is going to analyze our needs, decide how to cope with new
  challenges, which new functionalities should be implemented and
  which not?

- How competent is the partner I chose? What is their motivation? How
  is the price-quality ratio? Do they have concurrents?  Do I have a
  possibility to chose another partner in case I am not satisfied?

   ("cathedral") models in his book `The Cathedral and the Bazaar
