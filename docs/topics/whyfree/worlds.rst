==================================
The free and the proprietary
==================================

The world of `free software
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software>`_ and the world of
`proprietary software
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software>`_ are two
separate universes.  They are substantially different.

Free software is to computers what democracy is to society.  Free
software means democracy, proprietary software means dictature and
slavery.  Free software means that you are the master, a proprietary
software means that you are the slave.

Free software is the only choice if we want sustainable peace.
