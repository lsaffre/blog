The Lutsu manifesto
===================

Here is my current working draft for a manifesto about a long-term
copyright reform into a direction that is admittedly not being
considered a serious option at the moment.

The name is given after
`Lutsu talu <http://lutsu.ee/>`__, the place where I first talked
about this topic to others in June 2018.


The manifesto text
==================

We want a world where published content formulated as text, picture,
sound, movie or source code may be used and shared by everyone instead
of being legally considered a "private property" for which the "owner"
decides how it may be used or not.  This includes publications ranging
from simple postings in an Internet forum to books, songs, movies,
scientific reports, patents.

We don't want to abolish copyright as a whole.  We want to abolish a
part of it and enforce the other part.  Legislations about what is
commonly called "copyright" are about two very different things:

- Some copyright laws give the author a *right to control* how others
  use his work.  We want to abolish these.

- On the other hand there are laws that protect the author's *right to
  get acknowledged* and honoured as the creator of their work.  We
  want to maintain and extend these.

.. A third their *responsibility* for what they published
   
.. about plagiate and trademarks 

If we would develop our legislations into this direction, publishing
content would become an act of public interest and the production
costs would be covered by donations and public money.  Corporations
who currently rely on their intellectual property rights would convert
to foundations and start raising funds, as is done already now by
political parties, charity and religious organizations.

We are aware that the change is fundamental and that transition from
the current situation will not be easy: existing copyright holders
need to negotiate with their investors, laws must get reviewed,
enterprises must review their established methods of generating
income, ... Despite these challenges we believe that a transition is
possible and necessary.

We believe that this change is necessary because regulating the use
and sharing of digitally published content has become a Sisyphean
task causing absurd laws and requiring hordes of human resources in
public administrations.

We suggest the following roadmap:

#. realize the principal necessity of this change in direction
#. carefully develop plans how to change our direction
#. actively start redesigning our legislations accordingly

We ask politicians, public deciders, experts to join our movement in
order to start thinking together.

(This text is not definitive.  Nobody has signed it so far.  I am open
to suggestions and eventually adapt my text accordingly.  Please
contact me via email.)

Comments
========

I must add that e.g. Creative Commons or Wikipedia Foundation do *not*
agree with my idea.  They rather say that current copyright is
basically okay, they use it as a legal form for producing free open
content.  I state that we need a fundamental change where publishing
under a proprietary license becomes impossible or at least useless for
the author.
