Why software must be free
=========================

.. By :doc:`Luc Saffre </about/cv>`, independant developer of free
   customized database applications.

In this article I try to explain to non-programmers why software must
be free, why you should avoid proprietary software, why your
organization should choose `Linux
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux>`_ rather than `Windows
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows>`_ or `OS X
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X>`_ as the operating system on your
computers.

I also try to explain why this choice is currently not the mainstream
and why you should nevertheless consider it.

This text is not finished and probably never will be.

Summary
=======

Software must be free because the more your everyday life depends on
computers, the more it is important to ask who controls these
computers. Your sovereignty is not alienable.
