Common knowledge
================

The discussion about :doc:`/topics/whyfree/index` is part of a more
general idea.  Software must be free because it is a form of *common
knowledge*.

**Common knowledge** is knowledge that has been acquired and
formulated by more than one author. Such knowledge should *by default*
not be permitted to become private property.

An author who quotes other authors should get only the *honor* part of
their work, not the *revenue* part (compare :doc:`copyright`). The
*revenue* part, the right to share this knowledge, should be a human
right, freely granted to everybody.

For example when an end-user of a software asks a question about how
to use this software, then she is actively contributing to the
knowledge pool around that software.

Note the important relation between common knowledge and private data.
Public data should be usable, private data should be protected
[#CCC]_. Disclosing confidential data to the public is a criminal act
which cannot be undone.


.. [#CCC] "Öffentliche Daten nützen, private Daten schützen" is a
          slogan used by the CCC (`Hackeretik
