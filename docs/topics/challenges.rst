Yes, it might seem dispairing to try to find partners who meet all
criteria for maintaining the sovereignty and liberty of your
enterprise.  It seems like a vicious circle. Some challenges:

- A fundamental property of free software is that it cannot serve as
  capital.  While this is the inevitable condition for remaining free,
  it also reduces the motivation of all kinds of companies of private
  law to invest into free software.  A good manager takes care of not
  wasting time or money into projects that are "useless" in regard to
  their primary goal, namely to create benefit for the owners.  And
  the chances of success of an enterprise increase with the competence
  of its managers.  And successful enterprises tend to grow in size
  and power. So one might come to the conclusion that free software
  projects have no chance of becoming big and powerful.

- A widely spread attitude which I use to label `Uncle Tom's Advice
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Tom>`_ is to say "Come on!
  Stop making your own life complicated, we are all slaves of
  somebody, just let Microsoft or Google or Apple be your master and
  enjoy life!"[#eager]_.

.. [#eager] A good example of this opinion is Michael Eager's blog
            entry `Free Software Foundation vs Microsoft
            <http://www.embedded.com/electronics-blogs/open-mike/4440107/Free-Software-Foundation-vs-Microsoft>`_.
            Later (in a `closed thread on LinkedIn
            <https://www.linkedin.com/grp/post/43875-6037641137475301379>`_)
            he made iteven more clear: "Not sure what you (or FSF)
            mean by "draconian".  IP [intellectual property] laws
            apply to Microsoft, Coke, Intel, Ford, and LinkedIn, among
            many others. What is draconian about them?  Can you trust
            Intel to build chips correctly, Coke to bottle soda, Ford
            to build cars, and Linked in to host messages, without
            knowing all of the details of how this is done?  Do you
            drink Coke, drive a car, use a computer, eat at
            MacDonald's?"
