==================================
The free and the proprietary
==================================

Free software is to computers what democracy is to society.  Free
software means democracy, proprietary software means dictature and
slavery.

The world of `free software
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software>`_ and the world of
`proprietary software
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software>`_ are two
separate universes.  They are substantially different.

Free software is the only choice if we want sustainable peace.

A software product is the result of the collaboration of many humans.
