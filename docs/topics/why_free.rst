Why software must be free
=========================

.. By :doc:`Luc Saffre </about/cv>`, independant developer of free
   customized database applications.

In this article I try to explain to deciders of public institutions
and private enterprises, why software must be free, why your
organization should choose `Linux
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux>`_ rather than `Windows
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows>`_ or `OS X
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X>`_ as the operating system on your
computers.

I also try to explain why this choice is currently not the mainstream
and why you should nevertheless consider it.

This text is not finished and probably never will be.

Vocabulary
==========

The "free" in our context does not mean "free of costs" but "free of
bondage".  `Free software
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software>`_ is when users have the
freedom to *run* it, to *see the source code*, to *modify* it, and to
*distribute* both the original software and the adapted versions.

Free software is not to be confused with `Open-source software
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software>`_ (software with
its source code publicly available) or with `Freeware
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeware>`_ (software with no monetary
cost).

The world of `free software
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software>`_ and the world of
`proprietary software
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software>`_ are two
separate universes.  They communicate sometimes, but they are
substantially different.


Who controls my computers?
==========================

This section explains why it is important to ask who controls my
computers.

..  A software product is usually the result of the collaboration of
   many humans.  Free software means democracy, proprietary software
   means monocracy.  Eric S. Raymond describes the democratic
   ("bazaar") and monocratic ("cathedral") models in his book `The
   Cathedral and the Bazaar
   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar>`_.

Imagine that you are the owner of a well-running sandwich bar in a
little town.  And as your sandwich bar gets more and more customers,
you decide to engage an assistant to help you.  And because your
assistant is trustworthy and capable, you delegate more and more
reponsibilities to him.

Then imagine that you need to move to another town and designate your
assistant to become the manager of your sandwich bar.  The manager
continues to send you regular financial reports about your sandwich
bar.

Now imagine that after some time you discover that the manager of
your sandwich bar would refuse to show the invoices he received
and issued, and the statements of your bank accounts, saying "My
financial reports are enough, I don't want you to see the
underlying detailed bookings because it is my privacy how I
realized the results."  

How would you react?  You would probably fire this manager, maybe even
file a lawsuit against him.

That's how enterprises are run.  The managers do the work of ruling,
and they write regular activity reports to the owners. The managers
get a salary, and the owners get the profit.  The owners continue to
control their enterprise because they can fire their managers at any
moment.

That's how enterprises are run, and that's also how a computer works.
The computer hardware are the rooms of your sandwich bar, the
operating system is the manager. You communicate with your manager
using the keyboard and the monitor.

The point of this story is that if you fire such a manager in a
real-world enterprise, why do you run a closed-source software on your
computer?  

And although this story was written for enterprises, it applies to
public institutions as well except for some vocabulary. Replace
"owner" by "director" and "profit" by "honour".

I hope that this picture opens your eyes and that you start to feel
with me why it is important to wake up.



It's not about short-term freedom
=================================

Richard Stallman's `Free Software Definition
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Free_Software_Definition>`_ states
that users of free software get the freedom to look at source code, to
change it and to share their modifications.  

The problem with this formulation is that normal software users don't
want that freedom.  Normal users want to be able to phone their friend
and ask "How do you do when you want to format this document in two
columns instead of one?"  And they want well-written documentation and
a series of books about their software so that they can look up
themselves how to solve their problems.  That's the kind of freedom
they want.  And that's the kind of freedom they are more likely to get
when they use wide-spread software products owned by some
international worldwide corporation.

When we define freedom as "the power or right to act, speak, or think
as one wants" [#oxford1]_, then there is no need for free software
because proprietary software does not violate this freedom more often
than free software.  

So free software isn't about this kind of freedom.

But freedom also means "absence of subjection to foreign domination or
despotic government" or "the state of not being imprisoned or
enslaved".  [#oxford2]_ These meanings are more difficult to grasp
because they are less related to our everyday activities.

Think for example about a woman who enjoys wearing clothes which make
her more attractive to men.  There are probably not many such women in
countries like Afghanistan.  Most women in Afghanistan probably can't
even imagine that they are missing some part of life's joys. If you
asked one of them whether she would like to wear western clothes, you
will probably get a negative answer. So they are free, aren't they?

If you agree that women in Afghanistan are free, then proprietary
software is for you. Don't read on.


It's not about money
====================

A text titled "Unavoidable Ethical Questions About Open Source"
[#scu_questions]_ published by the Santa Clara Univerity in Silicon
Valley is formulated as a series of ethical questions which express
common arguments against free software.  Here are these questions,
together with my answers:

- **Is human knowledge advanced by full and free access to all
  information, allowing engineers and developers to correct and
  improve on already existing systems?** -- Answer: Yes.  "[T]he free
  sharing of useful information benefits the human community.  This
  sounds so obvious as to not merit discussion, but when this point is
  applied to real life, it seems to stir up a lot of controversy."
  [#cook]_

- **Or does a lack of strong protection for IP discourage innovation
  by removing the financial incentive for developing it?** -- Answer:
  Innovation is done by creative humans who act primarily because they
  love their work and not because they get money for it. Many modern
  slaves do some job just because they are getting money in return of
  the lifetime and energy they spend for working on some project which
  is not their's. These are not usually the ones who bring innovation.

- **Classically, free speech is understood as a right, but is this a
  useful way to think about open source software? Is there anything in
  the nature of software that would give people a right to it in the
  same way that we have a right to speech?** -- Writing software is
  substantially the same activity as writing a prosa text.
  Prohibiting to share software is like prohibiting to share
  texts. Proprietary software violates the basic human right for free
  speech.

- **Is it fair to expect software developers to create and distribute
  their intellectual product without restrictions while we do not
  expect the same from other inventors or producers?** -- Free
  software does not mean voluntary work. There are many people who
  earn their living for writing free software.  The free software
  industry shows that proprietary licensing is not the only way of
  making money using software amd that there are better methods to pay
  software developers for their work.

- **The Vatican document “Ethics in Internet” argues that “use of the
  new information technology... needs to be informed and guided by a
  resolute commitment to the practice of solidarity in the service of
  the common good.” Flowing from this view, the document says that
  “cyberspace ought to be a resource of comprehensive information and
  services available without charge to all, and in a wide range of
  languages. The winner in this process will be humanity as a whole
  and not just a wealthy elite that controls science, technology, and
  the planet's resources.” Is this view applicable to software as
  well?** -- Answer: Yes. The Vatican's document takes a beautifully
  clear position against proprietary software.  Software is stored
  knowledge about how a given job can be done. This is information. It
  is comprehensive only in the source code form.

- **(...) But to others, “sharing” software is like having to consent
  to its theft because the sharer is giving away someone’s work
  product, which is the result of sweat and ingenuity and which has
  monetary value, as well. Will open source inculcate the virtues of
  friends or of thieves?** -- Answer: Yes, using proprietary software
  without permission is theft, don't do that. Using free software is
  never theft because the author has publicly given their permission
  to share their work.  Note that the "monetary value" is usually not
  owned by those who gave their "sweat and ingenuity".

While my above answers --hopefully-- give satisfying answers to the
given arguments [#jesuits]_, all these thoughts are rather misleading
regarding to our original question about why software must be free.
Free software is definitively not about money, neither about the price
of the product nor about the wage of the author.

It is about power
=================

If you care about the sovereignty and liberty of your enterprise, then
you ask questions like the following:

- Who will help us when something goes wrong?

- Who is responsible for maintaining that software, for giving support
  to its end-users?

- How sustainable is my investment?  Who is going to decide whether to
  switch to some newer technology?  Or to discontinue some existing
  product and push us to migrate to a newer one?

- Who is going to analyze our needs, decide how to cope with new
  challenges, which new functionalities should be implemented and
  which not?

- How competent is that person or organization? What is their
  motivation? How is the price-quality ratio? Do they have
  concurrents?  Are they being regulated by the free market?

Yes, it might seem dispairing to try to find partners who meet all
criteria for maintaining the sovereignty and liberty of your
enterprise.  

It seems like a vicious circle. A fundamental property of free
software is that it cannot serve as capital.  While this is the
inevitable condition for remaining free, it also reduces the
motivation of all kinds of companies of private law to invest into
free software.  A good manager takes care of not wasting time or money
into projects that are "useless" in regard to their primary goal,
namely to create benefit for the owners.  And the chances of success
of an enterprise increase with the competence of its managers.  And
successful enterprises tend to grow in size and power. So one might
come to the conclusion that free software projects have no chance of
becoming big and powerful.

A widely spread attitude which I use to label `Uncle Tom's Advice
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Tom>`_ is "Come on!  Stop to make
your own life complicated!  In the end we are all slaves of somebody.
Just let Microsoft or Google or Apple be your master and enjoy
life!"[#eager]_.

My answer to this is yes, choosing free software *does* make our life
more complicated, and yes, we need to find trustworthy *partners*
because we cannot do everything ourselves, but no, our `sovereignity
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty>`_ at the software level
*is* necessary and worth the effort.


For the brave
=============

Choosing free software is actually *not* difficult. But most people
*believe* that it is. Which becomes a `self-fulfilling prophecy
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy>`_ causing
miscellaneous problems.  Here are some examples of the challenges you
are going to face if you decide for free software:

- Psychological effects ("Under Windows it would work better") ranging
  from personal reproaches for your decision to measurable
  side-effects.

- Using free software means that it is more difficult to get trained
  human resources, professional support, specialized hardware.

- The end-users themselves are reluctant to change their habits
  because they use proprietary software at home.

You will need to consider these challenges and decide bravely how to
react to them.  You will need measurable additional effort because you
are leaving the mainstream.


Conclusion
==========

Why software must be free?  Because the more our everyday lives depend
on computers, the more it is important to ask who controls these
computers.
