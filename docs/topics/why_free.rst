Why software must be free
=========================

.. By :doc:`Luc Saffre </about/cv>`, independant developer of free
   customized database applications.

In this article I try to explain to deciders of public institutions
and private enterprises, why software must be free, why you should
avoid proprietary software, why your organization should choose `Linux
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux>`_ rather than `Windows
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows>`_ or `OS X
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X>`_ as the operating system on your
computers.

I also try to explain why this choice is currently not the mainstream
and why you should nevertheless consider it.

This text is not finished and probably never will be.

If you care about the sovereignty and liberty of the information
systems in your enterprise or organization, you ask questions like the
following:

- Who will help us when something goes wrong? Who is responsible for
  maintaining that software, for giving support to its end-users?

- How sustainable is my investment?  Who is going to decide whether to
  switch to some newer technology?  Or to discontinue some existing
  product and push us to migrate to a newer one?

- Who is going to analyze our needs, decide how to cope with new
  challenges, which new functionalities should be implemented and
  which not?

- How competent is that organization? What is their motivation? How is
  the price-quality ratio? Do they have concurrents?  Are they being
  regulated by the free market? Do I have a possibility to chose
  another partner in case I am not satisfied?


A software product is usually the result of the collaboration of many
humans.  Free software means democracy, proprietary software means
monocracy.

.. Eric S. Raymond describes the democratic ("bazaar") and monocratic
   ("cathedral") models in his book `The Cathedral and the Bazaar
   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar>`_.

Yes, it might seem dispairing to try to find partners who meet all
criteria for maintaining the sovereignty and liberty of your
enterprise.  It seems like a vicious circle. 

A fundamental property of free software is that it cannot serve as
capital.  While this is the inevitable condition for remaining free,
it also reduces the motivation of all kinds of companies of private
law to invest into free software.  A good manager takes care of not
wasting time or money into projects that are "useless" in regard to
their primary goal, namely to create benefit for the owners.  And the
chances of success of an enterprise increase with the competence of
its managers.  And successful enterprises tend to grow in size and
power. So one might come to the conclusion that free software projects
have no chance of becoming big and powerful.

A widely spread attitude which I use to label `Uncle Tom's Advice
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Tom>`_ is "Come on!  Stop to make
your own life complicated!  In the end we are all slaves of somebody.
Just let Microsoft or Google or Apple be your master and enjoy
life!"[#eager]_.

My answer to this is yes, choosing free software *does* make our life
more complicated, and yes, we need to find trustworthy *partners*
because we cannot do everything ourselves, but no, our `sovereignity
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty>`_ at the software level
*is* necessary and worth the effort.


For the brave
=============

Choosing free software is actually *not* difficult. But most people
*believe* that it is. Which becomes a `self-fulfilling prophecy
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy>`_ causing
miscellaneous problems.  Here are some examples of the challenges you
are going to face if you decide for free software:

- Psychological effects ("Under Windows it would work better") ranging
  from personal reproaches for your decision to measurable
  side-effects.

- Using free software means that it is more difficult to get trained
  human resources, professional support, specialized hardware.

- The end-users themselves are reluctant to change their habits
  because they use proprietary software at home.

You will need to consider these challenges and decide bravely how to
react to them.  You will need measurable additional effort because you
are leaving the mainstream.


Conclusion
==========

Why software must be free?  Because the more our everyday lives depend
on computers, the more it is important to ask who controls these
computers.

.. [#eager] A good example of this opinion is Michael Eager's blog
            entry `Free Software Foundation vs Microsoft
            <http://www.embedded.com/electronics-blogs/open-mike/4440107/Free-Software-Foundation-vs-Microsoft>`_.
            Later (in a `closed thread on LinkedIn
            <https://www.linkedin.com/grp/post/43875-6037641137475301379>`_)
            he made iteven more clear: "Not sure what you (or FSF)
            mean by "draconian".  IP [intellectual property] laws
            apply to Microsoft, Coke, Intel, Ford, and LinkedIn, among
            many others. What is draconian about them?  Can you trust
            Intel to build chips correctly, Coke to bottle soda, Ford
            to build cars, and Linked in to host messages, without
            knowing all of the details of how this is done?  Do you
            drink Coke, drive a car, use a computer, eat at
            MacDonald's?"
