Copyright and freedom
=====================

Copyright versus author rights
==============================

The set of laws about what is commonly called "copyright" is actually
about two very different things. 

- One part is the right to claim **authorship** of your spiritual
  work. This part applies e.g. when you quote somebody else's work in
  your own book. When you just copy one sentence from a book, then you
  don't need to ask permission, but you must mention the original
  author.

- The other part is the right to distribute **copies** of this work.
  For example you write a book in the hope of becoming rich by selling
  millions of copies. You don't want somebody else to harvest the
  money that grew from your seed.

Vocabulary problems
===================

Note that many languages have no own word for copyright. They call it
"author right" (German *Autorenrecht*, French *droits d'auteur*).

The difference between "author rights" and "copyright" is of such
importance that I would report this unclear naming as a serious bug
(if humanity was a software project).

Honour and revenue
==================

These are the two important reasons why people do creative work.


motivations 


I'll call them the right on **honour** and the right on **revenue**.
