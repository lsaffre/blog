====================
Who rules the world?
====================

Yes, democracy has its weaknesses.  Currently most people wouldn't
even manage to govern a sandwich bar for more than a few years in a
democratic way. Not to speak about a village, a country or a planet.
Every year brings at least one sad example of a dictature which tries
to gain power over their neighbours.

Yes, we might worry wether our democratic structures actually govern
the world.  Recent years reveal a *shift of power from national states
to transnational corporations* [#vatican]_.

But history has told us that monarchies, aristocracies and dictatures
fail to bring peace and welfare in the long run.  "Democracy is a poor
system of government at best; the only thing that can honestly be said
in its favor is that it is about eight times as good as any other
method the human race has ever tried."  [#heinlein]_ 

Our western civilization is based on the assumption that governments
should be democratic.

The European Union and the United Nations are not free of problems,
but we must be immensely grateful for having them.  Governing the
earth in a peaceful way is one of the big challenges of humanity.
Already the Old Testament speaks about it (`Gen 1:28
<http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Genesis-1-28/>`_).
