Moving lino-framework.org to another server
===========================================

Is there a better Mailing lists manager than MailMan? MailMan has some disadvantages:

- difficult to integrate with a Lino database (:mod:`lino_xl.lib.lists`)
- not very intuitive web interface for subscribers and list managers
- difficult to move to another server

I read `Best Linux Mailing List Managers <https://www.linuxlinks.com/mailinglistmanagers/>`__`

I had a look at
`Sympa <https://www.sympa.org/>`__,
`Dada <https://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation-11_4_4/>`__
and `ezmlm-idx <http://untroubled.org/ezmlm/>`__
Sympa and Dada are written in Perl.  ezmlm seems to be written in C.
Sympa looked most sympathic...
