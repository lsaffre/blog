Released version 19.7.4 of XL to PyPI. (needed for testing :ref:`getlino`).

I am working on the interface between getlino and cookiecutter:
the :xfile:`pull.sh` and :xfile:`make_snapshots.sh` scripts.

Renamed shared-env to shared-dir (it does not only have a virtualenv but also a
shared static directory)

shared-env is now a server-side setting (i.e. asked during configure). But you
can also override it in startsite.

Added a ``--prod/no-prod``  option.  If you say ``--no-prod``, you will get a
development environment.

On a development server you can run startsite without being root.
