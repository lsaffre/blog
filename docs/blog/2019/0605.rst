Preparing the next :ref:`weleup` release
========================================

I worked on :ticket:`3034`. This time only on their production server. I
reviewed their :xfile:`initdb_from_prod.sh` and :xfile:`restore2preview.py`
scripts and ran them.

A strange thing I observed: some media files are not group readable.  I
have no idea how they do this.  Here is an example::

    $ go prod
    $ cd media
    $ find uploads ! -perm /g=w
    uploads/2019/03/20190218_112921.jpg
    uploads/2019/03/Wentgens_Wohnraum_2.jpg

    $ ll uploads/2019/03/*.jpg
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 www-data www-data 2230262 Mar 28 15:37 uploads/2019/03/20190218_112908.jpg
    -rw------- 1 www-data www-data 3017734 Mar 28 15:38 uploads/2019/03/20190218_112921.jpg
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 www-data www-data  596910 Mar  8 14:27 uploads/2019/03/Screenshot_20181024-123607_Samsung_Internet.jpg
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 www-data www-data 2206413 Mar 22 11:53 uploads/2019/03/Wentgens.jpg
    -rw------- 1 www-data www-data 2800880 Mar 22 11:55 uploads/2019/03/Wentgens_Wohnraum_2.jpg

I can "fix" this by saying::

    $ sudo find uploads ! -perm /g=w -exec chmod g+w '{}' +
    $ sudo find uploads ! -perm /g=r -exec chmod g+r '{}' +

But of course that does not eliminate the reason of the problem (there will be
more such files in the future).

I adapted their :xfile:`settings.py` to say ``lino_weleup.settings`` instead of
``lino_welfare.eupen.settings``.

TODO: Continue manual migrations in the :xfile:`restore2preview.py` script. I
stopped because I prefer to not run these processes during their work day.
