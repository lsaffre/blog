On Monday we had a day of rest in `Monastir
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastir,_Tunisia>`__. Kadur was our local guide
for visiting the `Ribat <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribat_of_Monastir>`__,
the Marina harbour, the Egdemsi peninsula (Jazīrat Sīdī al Ghudāmisī), the
Medina. Of course we also spent some hours on two beaches (La Falaise and Plage
du 3 août on Monday).

On Tuesday we said goodbye to Kadur and moved from Monastir to `Douz
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douz>`__. 5 hours in the car. Thanks to the air
conditioned. A short stop in `El Jem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Djem>`__
where Ly was our guide through the `Amphitheater
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphitheatre_of_El_Jem>`__.

We arrived in Douz shortly after sunset. Hamza had rented an apartment for us.
After an hour of rest we had dinner with Hamza in a high-level restaurant in the
tourist zone.
