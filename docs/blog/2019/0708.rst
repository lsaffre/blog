====================

I pushed my work on :ticket:`3110` (convert memo parser to a plugin):

A new plugin :mod:`lino.modlib.memo` regroups functionality which until now
was dispersed in :mod:`lino.mixins.bleached`, :mod:`lino.utils.memo` and
:mod:`lino.utils.soup`.

The :class:`lino.mixins.bleached.BleachedPreviewBody` model mixin has been
replaced by :class:`lino.modlib.memo.Previewable`.

.. currentmodule:: lino.modlib.comments

In :mod:`lino.modlib.comments`, :class:`Comment` needs a database migration
because instead of a single field :attr:`body_preview` it now has two fields
:attr:`short_preview <Comment.short_preview>` and
:attr:`full_preview <Comment.full_preview>`.

Summary of above changes also in :ref:`lino.changes.2019`.  The documentation
needs more work, but the book builds.
