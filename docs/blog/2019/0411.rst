Globally ignoring certain files in PyCharm
==========================================

I added the following patterns to the :guilabel:`Ignore files and folders`
field in :menuselection:`Settings --> Editor --> File Types` in PyCharm::

  .build;*.tar.gz;*.dist-info;env

Thanks to `intellij-support.jetbrains.com
<https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/206606355-Possible-to-mark-all-directories-named-build-as-excluded->`__
and Rich Eakin (who reported my problem) and Anastasia Kazakova (who answered
Rich's question).


Lino Presto advancing
=====================

I continued working for :ticket:`2776`.

DONE:

- I continued writing :ref:`presto.de.tour`.
- :attr:`Order.description` was a BabelTextField (we want a normal TextField).
- New option :attr:`lino.modlib.users.StartPlan.update_after_start`

- Clicking "Create invoices" a second time (when no calendar entry is getting
  invoiced), Lino must not create any order items.

- InvoicesByOrder. Should the sales.VatProductInvoice be ProjectRelated?

- Added DailyPlanner to main menu

TODO:

- DailyPlanner must be navigatable (like WorkedHours)
