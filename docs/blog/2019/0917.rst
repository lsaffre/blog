Replace nginx by apache
=======================

I started to think that actually we have much less work if I simply continue to
use apache on the weleup server.  Let's try::

  $ sudo apt purge nginx
  $ sudo apt install apache2

  $ cd /etc/apache2/sites-available/
  $ sudo scp -p user@oldsrv:/etc/apache2/sites-available/002-lino prod.conf

En passant I renamed site "a" to "weleup1".

I also started to think that we shouldn't use git clones on our production
servers any more.  So I must make a PyPI release of lino-weleup and
lino-welfare.

But here I got interrupted because my Thunderbird stopped to work.

Bad sector on my hard disk
==========================

A mail folder content file (not the index file) was corrupted because of a bad
sector.  Thunderbird froze each time it tried to rebuild the index file.

Actually each time you try to read the corrupted file, you get
an I/O error (after some timeout).  I was able to open the file using::

  luc@tups:~$ less .thunderbird/luc/Mail/Local\ Folders/Archives.sbd/2019

and the first page of the content gets was displayed.  But when I hit Ctrl+PgDn
to go to the end of the file, less reports a "read error". Thunderbird seems
less prepared to such read errors, it just froze. Closing the window was
possible, but when you try to open it again, it says that Thunderbird is still
"running but does not respond".

My last backup of my system was several days old and 100 km away.

As a funny coincidence my new notebook arrived this morning. A Tuxedo
InfinityBook 14.

I started copying my data from the old to the new notebook. A terabyte going
through our WLAN.  That takes some time, but the main challenge was to get it
working at all.  I had to run fsck in order to repair the corrupted file.  The
following took about 2 or 3 hours::

  luc@doll:~$ sudo e2fsck -cfpv /dev/sdb1

  Dell1TB:
  Dell1TB: UNEXPECTED INCONSISTENCY; RUN fsck MANUALLY.
  	(i.e., without -a or -p options)

I ran it again without -p and after 2 hours it started to ask me questions now
and then. I answered each of them by hitting ENTER.

Note that fsck requires the volume to be unmounted. So my whole data was
inaccessible for half a day...
