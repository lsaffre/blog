The new calendar view seems ready for a first presentation. Congratulations to
Tonis and Hamza who implemented this mostly without any assistance by Luc.

I am in the final sprint for :ticket:`2766`. I extended the
:mod:`lino_xl.lib.healthcare` plugin because they ask to have a history of
healthcare situations per client.  I realized (reading `this
<https://www.french-connect.com/147-sante-en-belgique-qu-est-ce-qu-une-intervention-majoree-et-un-statut-omnio.html>`__
and `this
<http://socialsante.wallonie.be/surendettement/citoyen/?q=node/434>`__) that
the VIPO state does not depend on the provider but is a status regulated by
national laws in Belgium.  Did more research about how VIPO, BIM and OMNIO are
related to each other.  TIL:

- They are properties of a client assigned independently of the health care provider
  (not a choice of a plan)

- BIM (bénéficiaire d'intervention majorée) is the new acronym for VIPO
