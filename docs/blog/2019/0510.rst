Wow, Tonis and Hamza once more did great work!
10am standup meeting, we decided that they would release to PyPI
While I was riding around Tallinn
with Ly. They released Lino and XL to PyPI for 2pm, I arrived shortly before
3pm for the meeting with Paul.  And on the demo site (on ML) I simply did::

  ./pull.sh
  a
  dm prep
  dm collectstatic
  restart_services.sh

And voil√†!

Some more quick changes before the rehearsal for the Presto demo next Tuesday.

Oops, I was quite quick to undo Hamza's work in
:file:`lino_presto/lib/cal/models.py`.  Let's have a look at it together later.
