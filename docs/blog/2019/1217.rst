I continued to work on :ticket:`2955`:

I fixed a bug in the Estonian VAT declaration (:mod:`lino_xl.lib.eevat`) : it
didn't yet handle Intracom purchases correctly.  Yes, we are approaching the
production-ready state :-)

New feature : national VAT implementations can now prefix observed fields of a
VAT declaration field with a "-" to indicate that the field is "inverted".

The demo fixture for :mod:`lino_xl.lib.sepa` now also sets the national VAT id
of some well-known providers in Estonia.  Until now they had "private person" as
:term:`VAT regime`.
