Testing :ref:`cosi` after :ticket:`3192`
========================================

I upgraded our :ref:`cosi` production server and tested :ticket:`3192`. Found
another problem : reset_totals doesn't yet work when returnable VAT is used.
Code changes:

When using :term:`returnable VAT`, the :attr:`total_vat` field is now always
empty and the :attr:`total_incl` field does not include the VAT.  This is valid
per invoice item and per invoice. The :attr:`total_incl` field is labelled
"Total to pay" also on items.  The amount of retturnable VAT is computed only
when the invoice is registered.
