I had yet another series of ideas for :ticket:`3036` and started working on
these: :meth:`lino.core.plugin.Plugin.get_requirements`, A new admin command
:manage:`configure`, merge :cmd:`getlino configure` and :cmd:`getlino setup`
(the differentiation is useless).

I had to decide how to name the combined command "configure" and "setup". Both
commands (the getlino command and the admin command) should have the same name
because they do similar things. But at different levels (in getlino we "setup"
or "configure" a production "server" which can run multiple "sites", with the
admin command we "setup" or "configure" the Python environment of a given
site).

The name "setup" is suboptimal because it makes us have a file named `setup.py`
in :mod:`lino.management.commands`, and that file name should be reserved for
the top-level :xfile:`setup.py`. So I finally opted for "configure" rather than
"setup". Another name candidate was "install" but I that would clash with
"installing Python modules".  You first install the lino application into the
environment of a site, then you "configure" that site (which will potentially
install more Python modules into the environment).
