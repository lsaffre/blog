=====================

I entered our purchase invoices into our :ref:`cosi`.  Which caused a series of
changes:

I added a detail view to :class:`lino_cosi.lib.contacts.Partners`.  While this
view is irritating in applications without accounting, for :ref:`cosi` it is
irritating to *not* have it.

The chooser for :attr:`lino_xl.lib.vat.VatDocument.vat_regime` had a typo bug
causing a :message:`TypeError: get_vat_regime_choices() takes from 0 to 2
positional arguments but 3 were given` when user tried to change the vat regime
of a voucher.

Using :kbd:`Ctrl+x` on a voucher to run
:meth:`lino_xl.lib.ledger.Voucher.toggle_state` changed the voucher state but
did not actually register the voucher (i.e. create movements, compute totals,
...).

I released version 19.7.3 of Lino and XL to PyPI. Although the test suites are
still failing.  I hope that th failures are trivial and only caused by the test
suite and not by a bug.
