I continued to work for :ref:`presto`.

Where to configure the default duration to be used when an event doesn't
contain an end_time?

Invoice generators have a new attribute :attr:`default_invoiceable_qty
<lino_xl.lib.invoicing.InvoiceGenerator.default_invoiceable_qty>` whose default
value is ``1`` (as it was until now, but now we can change the hard-coded
default value per application).

New field :attr:`lino_xl.lib.cal.EventType.default_duration` per calendar entry
type. If a calendar entry has a type (:attr:`event_type
<lino_xl.lib.cal.Event.event_type>`) and if that type has a default duration,
Lino will change the :attr:`end_time` of an entry when the :attr:`start_date`
is changed (and the :attr:`start_time` when the :attr:`end_date`)

The :mod:`lino_xl.lib.products` plugin adds one menu entry per product type.
Until now it used the label of the
:attr:`lino_xl.lib.products.ProductType.table_name`, now it uses the
:attr:`lino_xl.lib.products.ProductType.text`.  The difference appears if you
have several product types which use a same table.

Added demo data.

.. currentmodule:: lino.core.fields

The (:attr:`description <lino_xl.lib.orders.OrderItem.description>`) of an
order item  is now a single-line :class:`CharField` (not a multi-line
:class:`RichTextField`)

I am having a problem because :attr:`start_time
<lino_xl.lib.cal.Event.start_time>` is a :class:`TimeField` while
default_duration a :class:`DurationField`.  Errors like:

- Conversion from datetime.time to Decimal is not supported
- TypeError: conversion from NotImplementedType to Decimal is not supported
- TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'datetime.time' and 'datetime.time'

Continued tomorrow.
