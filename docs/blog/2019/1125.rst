=========================

Today I adapted the book test suite after changes in :ticket:`3313`.  This
caused some more API optimizations:

- New database field :attr:`lino_xl.lib.tickets.Site.private`.
- lino.core.auth.utils.AnonymousUser.is_anonymous
- New method :meth:`lino.modlib.comments.Commentable.add_comments_filter`

It's the first time I use a `Reverse Generic Relation
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/contrib/contenttypes/#reverse-generic-relations>`__.
We need it for specifying the filter condition
in :meth:`lino_xl.lib.tickets.Ticket.add_comments_filter`.

I recorded most of my work today in seven screen casts  "Watch Luc adapting the
doctests in book after changes for #3313" which  I published on youtube in a new
playlist named  `Lino developer sessions
<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5qugrzfIhI9G53OMI2Zb8Ao2wNCiPeXX>`__.
Updated the :ref:`dev.screencasts` page.




En passant (and without a screen cast) I also fixed a bug in atelier: You may
invoke :cmd:`inv test` from any subdir of the project.  But after the changes
for :ticket:`3340`  (use `unittest2` instead of :cmd:`python setup.py test`)
this was failing.  Now :mod:`atelier.invlib.tasks`  changes the current working
directory to the project's :attr:`root_dir` before launching
:envvar:`test_command`.
