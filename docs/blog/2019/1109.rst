I continued to review the Administrator Guide and discovered more problems in
getlino: the :xfile:`pull.sh` script generated by :cmd:`getlino configure` into
the shared virtualenv had no chance to work because it was still using the
project_dir.  No, the :xfile:`pull.sh` script must be per :term:`virtualenv`,
not per site.

Why does getlino have its own documentation tree?
Where should a reference to :xfile:`pull.sh` link to?
