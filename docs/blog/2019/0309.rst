Reviewed the book to get more newbie-friendly
=============================================

I reviewed the :ref:`book` with a potential newbie developer in mind and did
some reorganization::

    mv team/learning.rst dev/newbies
    mv team/newbies.rst dev/newbies/index.rst
    mv dev/newbies/index.rst dev/newbies/
    mv docs/team/prerequisites.rst docs/dev/newbies/
    mv user dev/quick

I am still thinking about the file names and URI structure.
The Lino book has three target reader groups:

- "about" deciders, stakeholders, surfers might read "About Lino" and watch the demos.
- "dev" Developers
- "admin" Hosting providers look at the Hoster's guide

The Developers guide differentiates "application developers" from "contributors".

There are two versions of sections "Get started" and "Install Lino"
