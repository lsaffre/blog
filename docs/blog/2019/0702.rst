Seeing how much we work
=======================


I added a new model :class:`UserSummary <lino_xl.working.UserSummary>` to
:mod:`lino_xl.working`. Similar to :class:`lino_xl.working.SiteSummary
<SiteSummary>`, but per user instead of per site and monthly instead of yearly.

I would like to have these numbers more visible so we can talk about them in
evaluation meetings. I continue to believe in our team policy of paying fixed
monthly wage independently of worked hours.
