I did more testing and optimizations for the :ref:`presto` prototype.

For example I realized that they probably want to have the
:mod:`lino_xl.lib.phones` plugin.

And in :mod:`lino_xl.lib.households` a member type "Forster-child" was missing.

I converted the docs of this plugin from autodoc to prosa style.

The :fiture:`demo` fixture for presto now creates more realistic income categories and price rules.

:class:`lino_xl.lib.products.Product` is now duplicable.
