I had a problem when updating PyCharm to 2019.1.1. It complained about a
missing write permission to some file :file:`jre64/bin`.  I ran
:file:`pycharm.sh` as root (after reading `this
<https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/206601265-Fixed-PyCharm-automatic-update-fails-on-Linux-due-to-permissions>`__



I realized that updatedb (and therefore locate) did not find files on my
additional SDD.  This SDD was mounted in  my /etc/fstab as follows:

    # LS 20150919
    UUID=4bd37ec4-1371-4b13-b43e-9ec125fad143 /media/dell1tb ext4 defaults 0 2

And yes, my :file:`/etc/updatedb.conf` says::

  PRUNEPATHS="/tmp /var/spool /media /var/lib/os-prober /var/lib/ceph /home/.ecryptfs /var/lib/schroot"

And I don't want to remove /media from PRUNEPATHS.

I also had a symbolic link :file:`/home/luc/dell1tb` which points to
:file:`/media/dell1tb`.

I now removed that symbolic link and have fstab mount the SSD device directly
to :file:`/home/luc/dell1tb`.

Afterwards I had to repair a few things which had been relying on
:file:`/media/dell1tb`:

For example a series of symbolic links in my home directory (Documents,
Downloads, Videos, work, vbshared2, etc.)

Or my virtualenvs...  I recreated the default py3 env using my script
:xfile:`install_dev_projects.sh` (which I updated en passant).

I still have a series of warnings when I invoke PyCharm::

    OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM warning: Option UseConcMarkSweepGC was deprecated in version 9.0 and will likely be removed in a future release.
