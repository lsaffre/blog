Yesterday I wanted to ask Hamza to do this:

- move the tests about birth_date and age into a separate page
- move tests about IncompleteDate to this page
- remove useless tests (now that the bug is fixed)
- move boring content to the end, and interesting features to the beginning.

But we didn't have enough time. Also I realized that you cannot delegate
everything, so I now did it myself.
