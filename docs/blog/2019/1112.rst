Some members of the rello mailinglist don't receive any mail after moving to the
new server.  The :file:`/var/log/mail.err` says::

  pam_authenticate() failed: Authentication failure (/etc/pam.d/imap missing?)

I read the `Dovecot docs
<https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dovecot#PAM_Authentication>`__ and
compared the configs of old and new server... but without success.



I also stumbled into :ticket:`3333` (Unable to create comments with invalid
@user or #ticket):  When I post a comment "Try #foobar baz", then the comment
gets created, but the action returns a single text line ``ValueError: invalid
literal for int() with base 10: 'foobar'`` instead of JSON object with ``{
"success": true, "message": ... }``

I changed test_notify.py in team demo project to reproduce the problem.

TODO: A same file test_notify.py exists in the eric demo project. Shouldn't that
file go away because it is redundant? What is the difference between eric and
team?

And while I was there I also fixed the problem. Note: Hamza is the culprit :-)
his work for :ticket:`3108` didn't handle exceptions.
