Lino Cos√¨ for Rumma & Ko
========================

I released version :ref:`cosi.19.2.0` of :ref:`cosi`.  Before actually
finishing this task, I had a few "triggered" tasks:

- A little optimization in :ref:`atelier`  (renamed notag to nobranch).

- I saw that Hamza has added a button "Close and save window" (:ticket:`2816`)
  but forgot to write a change note.

- I committed some changes in :ref:`book` for repairing the test suite.

Also after the release I continued to repair the book test suite after my
changes for :ticket:`2834`. I translated  "library volume" to "Dateibibliothek"
(de) and "Librairie de fichiers" (fr).


:ref:`presto` continues
=======================

I continued working for :ticket:`2776`.
Started the German user guide with release notes:
:ref:`presto.19.2.0`
