I started to review the README files of lino, xl and cosi so that newcomers
like Marc would find us more easily.


The Lino team started using Mattermost

Greg Polec writes in `Software Development Outsourcing setbacks to avoid from
now on
<https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/software-development-outsourcing-setbacks-avoid-from-now-greg-polec/>`__
that communication with a team of developers is a key factor for successful
outsourcing, and that outsourcers must "minimize the risk of ineffective
communication".  How true! He then advises team project management tools such
as as Jira, Trello, or Slack because "all works are transparent for both sides"
and the customer gets "a constant control over a current developers’ progress".

We started to use https://framateam.org/lino-dev as our platform for
discussion. This service is run by `framasoft
<https://framasoft.org/en/association>`__, a non-profit organization in France
using `Mattermost <https://www.mattermost.org/>`__, an open source, self-hosted
Slack-alternative.

I checked the `License <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/blob/master/LICENSE.txt>`__
and their `Manifesto <https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/manifesto.html>`__
and think that it is okay.

Slack ask 6,25€ per user per month and I think that framasoft should
theoretically get some amount like this from us for their service. But also the
PSF and the DSF deserve some donations from Lino. And OTOH I must keep an eye
on our budget.  Until now Rumma & Ko has been profitable and that's a good
thing because it allows me to grant the wage for Tonis and Hamza at least until
end of 2019.  But at the moment my feeling says that we cannot afford any
donations.

Another thing (after reading `Mattermost vs. Slack for Enterprise
<https://mattermost.com/mattermost-vs-slack/>`__) is that actually we should
rather host our own instance of Mattermost.
