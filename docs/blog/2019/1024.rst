I recorded yet another `screencast <https://youtu.be/5TPzfDBvbBM>`__ where I
reproduce :ticket:`3293`. The screencast is quite long because I must first
install nginx on my machine and stumble into some getlino pitfalls. Only the
last few minutes show the actual problem (for which I didn't find the solution
and which is rather urgent).

I ask Tonis to have a look at this (because Hamza is still working on :ticket:`3108`).
The screencast might be interesting for Amber as well.
