I fixed the following failures on :ref:`travis`:

- https://travis-ci.org/lino-framework/welfare/jobs/513044368
- https://travis-ci.org/lino-framework/book/jobs/513043901
- https://travis-ci.org/lino-framework/book/jobs/513043904

I added a docs page about :ref:`dev.shared`, reviewed them and their usage in
book, lino, xl, presto, pronto and welfare.

I also reviewed the :ref:`dev.specs` page and the headings of plugins in
:ref:`book.specs`.
