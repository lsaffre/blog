Standup meetings
================


On Sunday I wrote the following mail to Tonis and Hamza:

    Let's try to get used in having short voice meetings several times per week. I suggest the following times (in Estonian time zone):

    | Monday 10:00
    | Wednesday 10:00
    | Friday 10:00

    Please let us know if you cannot join or would like to change a time.

    A general topic on each meeting are the `Three Questions
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting>`__. Our current "sprints":

    - React frontend
    - ExtJS optimizations
    - measure and increase coverage
    - use Jane/Hobbit for chatting
    - SOS (Presto)
    - Chatelet (Welfare)
    - Mads Michael (Lino Cos√¨)

    Maybe we can use a fixed URL on Framatalk instead of Hangouts:
    https://framatalk.org/linocore

Today we had our second meeting.  Seems to work well, and it seems that this
might turn out a historic step for our team.  A bravo to Tonis for being a
constructive and efficient meeting moderator.  A bravo to Hamza for his clear
explanation about how :ticket:`2841` could happen. Yes, mistakes do happen, and
a good team is where you value mistakes as something to learn from (instead of
hiding them away as something to be ashamed of).  We are a good team.


Library files finished
======================

I finally finished to adapt the book test suite after my changes for
:ticket:`2834` last week (:doc:`0212`).

One test (:file:`docs/plugins/export_excel.rst`)  is still failing with
:message:`UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode characters in position
2-3: ordinal not in range(128)`.  I vaguely remember that Hamza has been
working on this as well.

I also checked in some more changes for :ticket:`2776` (:ref:`presto`):

- It is now possible to easily redefine the detail layout for :class:`lino_xl.lib.cal.Rooms` by overriding :class:`lino_xl.lib.cal.RoomDetail`
