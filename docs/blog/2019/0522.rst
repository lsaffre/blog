Uff, I finally got some time to dive into :ticket:`3010`.
The :class:`lino_xl.lib.courses.StatusReport` was not being
rendered in the dashboard.
And we didn't notice it until Johanna reported it after their last release.

I fixed it for now, but my fix is not optimal.
The two :meth:`show_story` methods in :mod:`lino.core.renderer` now have an additional ``elif`` for this case.
The whole concept of a "story" is still a bit vague and should be more generalized.
Also the differentiation between BaseRequest and its subclasses is maybe useless.

I did not yet find out when the problem had been introduced.
It seems that no test case covered it.
Simply calling ``rt.show(courses.StatusReport)`` in a doctest worked okay.
The :meth:`lino.core.requests.BaseRequest.show_dashboard`
method would have shown it, but it is not used often.
It is used in :ref:`specs.tera.cal`,
but this user didn't see that report.
In :ref:`welfare.specs.main` we also called it but that test was being skipped.git st

I now added a test in :ref:`avanti.specs.general`.
