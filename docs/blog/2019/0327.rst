Together with Hamza I converted the specs for :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.isip`
from the (old) autodoc style to the (new) prosa style.

Also we started a page about :ref:`guide.backups` in the general Lino User's
Guide.  That page will be for customers who are hosting a Lino application on
:ref:`ml`.
