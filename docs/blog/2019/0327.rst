Together with Hamza I converted the specs for :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.isip`
from the (old) autodoc style to the (new) prosa style.

Also we started a page about :ref:`guide.backups` in the general Lino User's
Guide.  That page will be for customers who are hosting a Lino application on
:ref:`ml`.

I am still trying to repair the welfare test suite. The German label for field
:attr:`MergeAction.reason` should be "Begr√ºndung", but ``doctest
docs/specs/weleup/eupen.rst`` is failing on my machine saying it should be
"Grund". The problem is probably caused by the reorganisation of the welfare
repositories.
