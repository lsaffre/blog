Stand-up meeting
================

Tonis is working on miscellaneous tickets (calendar view, ...).

Hamza and I are both working on :ticket:`3036`.  :term:`getlino`.

Hamza will try to get :option:`getlino configure --https` to work. The
challenge is that he needs to setup a testing environment: create an account at
dynu.com to get a public domain name, then setup his router correctly.

I will try to continue with the webdav support.
