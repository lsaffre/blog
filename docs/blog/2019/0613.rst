For :ticket:`3042` I moved more content from the "Community" section of the
:ref:`book` to the `Community Guide <http://community.lino-framework.org/>`__.
I realize that  there is much work to do, but I also feel that it is necessary
work in the right direction.  The Lino Community needs a generally
understandable and clearly defined vocabulary which can be used in all kinds of
agreements.  Some texts still explain things using "you" or "me" without
clearly saying who is meant. Until now Rumma & Ko has maintenance contracts
where the customer is site operator, application owner and server provider.  I
need to split these concepts into more general sections...
