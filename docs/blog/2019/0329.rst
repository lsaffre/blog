My comment: Has somebody tried to compute how much human power and public money
has been used in the last five years for this discussion? I don't know the
number, but we probably agree that it is *huge*. What a waste of money and
energy! It is wasted since it goes into the wrong direction.  I wrote a `blog
post <http://lutsu.saffre-rumma.net/blog/2019/0329.html>`__ in the Lutsu
project and invite everybody to sign the `Manifesto

Test suites
===========

Tonis, Hamza and I had some fun with getting the test suites to pass again
after several days of three committers working frantically.

After upgrading to Sphinx 2.0 the :rst:dir:`tickets_table` directive is broken.
I threw it away without tears.
