Rebasing a pull request for Sphinx
==================================

Takeshi asked me to "could you rebase this into 1.8 branch?" in `my pull
request to sphinx-doc <https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/6139>`__.
Sounds like trivial, but I feel too old for such kind of jobs. Let's try::


    $ git rebase upstream/1.8
    First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
    Generating patches: 100% (606/606), done.
    Applying: add support for partial matches in js search
    Using index info to reconstruct a base tree...
    A	sphinx/themes/basic/static/searchtools.js_t
    Falling back to patching base and 3-way merge...
    Auto-merging sphinx/themes/basic/static/searchtools.js
    Applying: #1618 make search results reader friendly
    Using index info to reconstruct a base tree...
    A	sphinx/themes/basic/static/searchtools.js_t
    Falling back to patching base and 3-way merge...
    Auto-merging sphinx/themes/basic/static/searchtools.js
    CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in sphinx/themes/basic/static/searchtools.js
    error: Failed to merge in the changes.
    Patch failed at 0002 #1618 make search results reader friendly
    Use 'git am --show-current-patch' to see the failed patch

    Resolve all conflicts manually, mark them as resolved with
    "git add/rm <conflicted_files>", then run "git rebase --continue".
    You can instead skip this commit: run "git rebase --skip".
    To abort and get back to the state before "git rebase", run "git rebase --abort".

Something is failing.  That was not the right thing to do. So I abort it::

    $ git rebase --abort

Similar result in interactive mode::

    $ git rebase -i upstream/1.8
    Already running
    Performing inexact rename detection: 100% (17100/17100), done.
    Auto-merging sphinx/themes/basic/static/searchtools.js
    CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in sphinx/themes/basic/static/searchtools.js

    Resolve all conflicts manually, mark them as resolved with
    "git add/rm <conflicted_files>", then run "git rebase --continue".
    You can instead skip this commit: run "git rebase --skip".
    To abort and get back to the state before "git rebase", run "git rebase --abort".

    Could not apply 14e39adb8... #1618 make search results reader friendly request results as HTML instead of source files retrieve preview snippet text from HTML
    $ git rebase --abort

At this point Tonis helped me to do a cherrypick using gitkraken.  Don't ask me
how this would look at teh command line. Then again at the command line::

    $ git push origin 1.8

    Compressing objects: 100% (12/12), done.

    remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (10/10), completed with 7 local objects.
    remote:
    remote: Create a pull request for '1.8' on GitHub by visiting:
    remote:      https://github.com/lsaffre/sphinx/pull/new/1.8
    remote:
    To github.com:lsaffre/sphinx.git
     * [new branch]          1.8 -> 1.8


Then in the github web interface I created a new pull request::

    https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/6148


How to suggest changes in the README file
=========================================

Some days ago Marc wrote "One thing that disturbed me when discovering Lino
earlier this week is the absence of a requirements / support specification
(that is: python versions, windows support, etc)."

This is the kind of things I believe that others have easier to formulate than
I. So now I reviewed the :ref:`dev.setup_info` page for Marc.
