I started to fix the failures in the book test suite after my changes for
:ticket:`2826`.

>>> from lino import startup
>>> startup('lino_book.projects.min1.settings')
>>> from lino.api.doctest import *
>>> import json
>>> from lino.utils.jsgen import py2js
>>> v = {"message": 'This is a "cool" thing. '}
>>> print(json.dumps(v))
{"message": "This is a \"cool\" thing. "}
>>> print(py2js(v))
{"message": "This is a \"cool\" thing. "}
