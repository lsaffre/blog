WebDAV support
==============

I pushed my work on :ticket:`3036`. Summary of the changes:


.. program:: getlino configure

I added a new option :option:`--webdav` which causes the nginx conf file to have
a webdav location.

I reviewed the docs (:ref:`webdav`, :ref:`getlino`).

The default value for :option:`--repositories-root` is now an empty string.

Running :cmd:`getlino startsite` on a server with a shared env (i.e. a
non-empty value for :option:`--shared-env`) must never update existing packages
in a shared env, but it should add new repositories. We don't want one site to
potentially break the shared environment. But automatically adding new
repositories is handy when setting up a development environment.

If you have a shared-env but an empty repositories-root, Lino
will install new repositories below the shared env (root path is built by
appending :option:`--env-link` to the shared env).

You can have an empty shared-env and a non-empty repositories-root. The new
site has its own env, but uses repositories from your work directories. Useful
on a development machine.

New option :option:`--local-prefix` which defaults to 'lino_local'. This is the
top-level package name for importable code. On a server with
:file:`/usr/local/lino/` as :option:`--projects-root`  we will have the
following layout::

    /usr/local/lino/lino_local/mysite1      # a the mysite1 project
    /usr/local/lino/lino_local/settings.py  # server-wide default settings

The projects-root will be added to the :envvar:`PYTHON_PATH` when a project
runs. The :xfile:`settings.py` of a new site says ``from lino_local.settings
import *``, and the :xfile:`manage.py` sets :setting:`DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`
to ``'lino_local.mysite1.settings'``.

The "project directory" of a project "mysite1" is now
:file:`/usr/local/lino/lino_local/mysite1` (no longer
:file:`/usr/local/lino/mysite1`).  If you want to preserve your existing sites,
you must say something like this::

    $ cd /usr/local/lino/lino_local
    $ mkdir lino_local
    $ mv mysite1 lino_local/
    $ mv shared/*.py lino_local/



The default for :option:`--shared-env` is an empty string, which means that new
sites will get their own environment.  This is the normal case on a production
server.

Why do we have an option :option:`--repositories-root`? Can't we simply say
that this is always built from :option:`--shared-env` by appending
:option:`--env-link`?  Because on a development machine you may have e.g.::

    projects_root = /usr/local/lino
    repositories_root = /home/luc/dell1tb/work
    shared_env = /home/luc/dell1tb/virtualenvs/py3



I merged KNOWN_LIBS and KNOWN_APPS

TODO:

- The lino_*.js files generated by nginx for the first request are not group
  writable. Which means that umask is not set correctly for the nginx service.

- rename projects-root to sites-root and project_dir to site_dir (Django calls
  them "projects" but we call them "sites").  A :term:`Lino project` is
  definitively not the same as a :term:`Lino site`.


Community Guide
===============

General top-level structure of the :ref:`cg` should probably be:

- About this document (free to use in your agreements, maintained by the LSF, ...)
- About the LSF (actors, contacts, ...)
- About Lino projects (life cycle, ...)
- Community rules (agreements, ...)


Django migrations
=================

I'd like us to start playing with Django migrations.
Here are some instructions for getting started with :ticket:`2322`.

Preliminary readings:

- https://realpython.com/django-migrations-a-primer/ is a good introduction to the topic.
- https://realpython.com/digging-deeper-into-migrations/ important to understand

To start playing, you can now go to cosi demo project (e.g. apc or pierre) and
run :manage:`makemigrations`.  You will get::

    $ pm makemigrations
    No changes detected

No Lino plugin has a :xfile:`migrations` directory, which means for Django that
no plugin participates in the migrations game.

You can say::

    $ pm makemigrations contacts
    Migrations for 'contacts':
      /path/to/work/cosi/lino_cosi/lib/contacts/migrations/0001_initial.py
        - Create model CompanyType
        - Create model Partner
        - Create model Role
        - Create model RoleType
        - Create model Company
        - Create model Person
        - Add field type to role
        - Add field city to partner
        - Add field country to partner
        - Add field payment_term to partner
        - Add field purchase_account to partner
        - Add field region to partner
        - Add field company to role
        - Add field person to role

But that won't help us because it creates the migrations in the wrong place.
Django migrations cannot be stored individually per plugin because the database
structure of a plugin can vary depending on other plugins of the application.

So please remove the
:file:`/path/to/work/cosi/lino_cosi/lib/contacts/migrations` before going on.

When :attr:`migration_module <lino.core.site.Site.migration_module>` is `None`,

Now uncomment the following line in
:mod:`lino_cosi.lib.cosi.settings`::

    class Site(Site):
        ...
        migration_module = 'lino_cosi.lib.cosi'

When :attr:`migration_module <lino.core.site.Site.migration_module>`
is set, Lino automatically sets the :setting:`MIGRATION_MODULES`
setting to something like this::

  MIGRATION_MODULES = {
     "contacts" : "lino_cosi.lib.cosi`,
     "ledger" : "lino_cosi.lib.cosi`,
     ...
  }

IOW for all plugins that have at least one model, if adds an item to that
dictionary.

The :attr:`migration_module <lino.core.site.Site.migration_module>` specifies
the *main plugin** of an application.  For :ref:`cosi` this would be
:mod:`lino_cosi.lib.cosi`.


Note that the :mod:`lino_cosi.lib.cosi` plugin has already a central role
because it holds the :xfile:`locales` directory for all cosi plugins.  It would
now also hold a :xfile:`migrations`  directory.

Now try again to run :manage:`makemigrations`.  You will get::

   django.db.migrations.exceptions.BadMigrationError: Migration user_types in app lino has no Migration class

I guess that this caused by the choicelist fields which do not yet have a
`serializer
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/migrations/#serializing-values>`__
defined or because the :meth:`deconstruct` method is wrong. See `here
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/migrations/#adding-a-deconstruct-method>`__.

Next step for :ticket:`2322` would be to get this to pass and to generate an
initial migration in :file:`lino_cosi/lib/cosi/migrations`.
