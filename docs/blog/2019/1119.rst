Documentation about help texts
==============================

I answered to a question posted by Amber on the lino-developers mailing list.

He wrote:

  'Sign in', is self explanatory. Now it is showing the message to the User
  (external, to the customer ), "Open a window which asks for username and
  password and which authenticates as this user when submitted". I guess, this
  message is for internal use and for (Developer/Technical) and not for an
  external user. When the mouse pointer at the 'Sign in', it could be found,
  most of the sites/products do not have any message, at all.


This is indeed the help text of the SignIn action. I agree that this is not the
optimal help text.  It is currently rendered in the Lino Book, in the specs page
for the users plugin: :class:`lino.modlib.users.SignIn`.

The source code for this is in the book repository, in the file
docs/specs/users.rst file which you should have on your computer.

I invite you to change that file on your computer and to submit a pull request!

But note that you won't see your change immediately in a runserver because you
need to build the book for that. I assume that you now want to learn more about
help texts. So I started to review the :ref:`help_texts` page because as usual,
documentation grows upon request. Thanks for requesting!
