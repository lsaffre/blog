Watch Luc working : my second screencast for developers
=======================================================

Today once more I recorded myself while working. This is my second developer
screencast and it's called "Luc working on #3284". It has three parts so far:
`part 1 <https://youtu.be/r_r0ETA0KgU>`_ / `part 2
<https://youtu.be/tyXxBSjQNOU>`_ / `part 3 <https://youtu.be/SlnUoYnZ5Qk>`_.
It is about 2 hours of watch.

Here is what I did in that series of screncasts:

I did :ticket:`3284` : :ref:`noi` now uses :mod:`lino_xl.lib.groups`.  Actually
a new plugin :mod:`lino_noi.lib.groups` (an extension of
:mod:`lino_xl.lib.groups`) which extends Group to add a :attr:`user` field (the
"team manager"). It also changes the verbose name "Group" to "Team". Added a
field :attr:`lino_noi.lib.tickets.Site.group` and adapted the
get_notifications_owner method of :class:`lino_noi.lib.tickets.Ticket` to return
the group of the site instead of the site.

The :fixture:`demo` fixture of :mod:`lino_xl.lib.groups` now adds first names
for every user because otherwise Lino complains when users.Users inherits from
`contacts.Person`

.. currentmodule:: lino_xl.lib.groups

In :mod:`lino_xl.lib.groups` the :attr:`Membership.user` field is now
labeled "User" instead of "Author", and the model now has a detail layout and an
insert layout (e.g. :class:`MembersByGroup` now has a insert button)
