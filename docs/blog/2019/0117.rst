==========================

I am doing the yearly accounting report in TIM.
I optimized :file:`DLM/ee/PERKMD.REP` (in 2018 I learned how to declare invoices from OVH)


I spoke with Yvonne and she explained me that they start to get impatient.
They want a Lino.
Especially for writing offers.
I explained her why she must still wait.

But afterwards I thought that Yvonne is intelligent and motivated to help with
testing and giving feedback.  What are we waiting for?! I opened :ticket:`2798`
and started to work on it.

I noted that the :ref:`cosi` demo needs a bit of polishing.

For example printing invoices was broken (since we changed the default build
method from appy to weasy).  It said "No template found for
sales/VatProductInvoice/default.weasy.html, excerpts/default.weasy.html"

I created a new template
:xfile:`sales/VatProductInvoice/default.weasy.html`
(in the :xfile:`config` directory of :mod:`lino_xl.lib.sales`).

The demo fixtures now also create a journal "Offers".  An offer is technically
the same as an invoice, except that it doesn't generate ledger movements.

The :attr:`ref_max_length <lino.mixins.Referrable.ref_max_length>` for
:class:`lino_xl.lib.ledger.Journal` is now 5 instead of the default 40.
