Multiple primary coachings
==========================

I did :ticket:`3137` for :ref:`welcht` : New plugin setting
:attr:`multiple_primary_coachings
<lino_xl.lib.coachings.Plugin.multiple_primary_coachings>` for
:mod:`lino_xl.lib.coachings`.  When this is set to True, the uniqueness of the
primary coaching is no longer just per client but per client and :term:`coaching
type`. As a result you can have multiple primary coachings per client.

I applied this change as a local patch on their :term:`production site`.
