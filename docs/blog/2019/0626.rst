Optimizations for Presto
========================

I worked for :ticket:`3091` (some optimizations for :ref:`presto` requested by
Margarete):

- Customized cal.EntriesByProject
- The detail window of a worker now shows orders.EnrolmentsByWorker
- Some translations and ui labels.

- Presto uses again tinymce because the default extjs editor has sizing
  problems and is not really usable.

I didn't push these changes because running the test suite revealed another
problem.  See :doc:`0627`.
