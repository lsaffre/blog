Not only Yvonne is waiting for Lino, also Danny.  And Danny actually might want
a :ref:`cosi`.  Which confirms my intuitive choice yesterday of starting
:ref:`pronto` for Yvonne.  Both users are actually quite similar: they have a
list of products and services, and they sell them. They also record their
purchases and declare their VAT And they record their bank statements and check
whether the customers pay their invoices.

Pronto is just a kind of extended cosi.  It will also have "component sheets"
which are a group of products to be reused in one or several offers or
invoices.
