========================

I found some time to continue with :ref:`presto` (:ticket:`2776`).

DONE:

- :attr:`lino_xl.lib.orders.Order.project` and
  :attr:`lino_xl.lib.orders.Order.invoice_recipient` were missing in OrderDetail.

- :attr:`lino_xl.lib.orders.Order.update_all_guests` caused a UNIQUE error
  because the workers were being suggested twice.

- Optimized the layout of :class:`lino_xl.lib.cal.EventDetail`

- When a user manually creates an event on a controller, then Lino now
  also calls :meth:`lino_xl.lib.cal.RecurrenceSet.before_auto_event_save` and :meth:`lino_xl.lib.cal.EventGenerator.auto_cal_event_type` (if the controller is an instance of these)

- Demo data : set event_type per room. force_guest_state

- GuestsByEvent in :ref:`presto` no longer shows the workflow buttons (i.e. all
  calendar entry types should have force_guest_state True)

- Invoicing now works. Wrote a new plugin :mod:`lino_presto.lib.invoicing`
  (copied from :mod:`lino_tera.lib.invoicing`) because they will want to create
  an invoice for a given order.

TODO:

- a button per order to directly create an invoice from an order (i.e. open the
  plan, fill it, execute it and open a detail on the generated invoice). caveats:
  what if an invoice already exists?  What if there is more than one invoice?...

- if a calendar entry has no duration, use a configurable default duration
