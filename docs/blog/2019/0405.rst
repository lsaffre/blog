Another series of changes for :ref:`cosi`
=========================================

Mads Michael gave more feedback about :ticket:`2810` (Migrate Rumma & Ko
accounting from TIM to :ref:`cosi`):

    While there now is an automatic link from the suppliers VAT regime to the VAT
    regime when entering a new invoice for the same supplier, there should in my
    opinion also be an automatic link from the VAT regime to the VAT class in the
    row where you enter the numbers. I wonder if there is in fact any reason for
    having both a "VAT regime" and a "VAT class". Wouldn't it just be simpler to
    have one set of categories ?

    Although I can use the VAT class "exempt from VAT" for intra-EU invoices it is
    not quite correct. In order to get the declarations correct there should be a
    separate VAT class for the reverse charge or are the declarations based on the
    VAT regime chosen ? Even if it is so, the term "Exempt from VAT" for reverse
    charge intra-community VAT is incorrect and would confuse accountants.

    I just tried to look at the VAT declaration page which seems quite
    incomprehensible to me. I tried to look at 2018 in full after having entered
    data for Zone OÃœ which has 2 invoices with VAT, but no numbers showed up, only
    an error message "Ajax communication failed".

    There should be possibility and documentation about how to set up new
    categories and define the rate and debit and credit accounts in addition to the
    standard set-up.

This took (several days of work) and caused the changes described in :doc:`0409`.
