Olivier gave their feedback for :ref:`tera.18.12.0` and I started
:ticket:`2777` (Tarifordnung und Bemerkungen nach 18.12.0).

I understood that it is not the tariff ("Flat rate") they want to specify per
enrollment, but the "household composition" is actually the number of
participants below 18.

Added a custom choosers for :attr:`lino_tera.lib.courses.Course.product` and
:attr:`lino_tera.lib.courses.Enrolment.product`.  Both choosers use the same
utility function :func:`lino_tera.lib.courses.get_product_choices`.

Some layout changes and descriptions to make things more clear.

:class:`lino_xl.lib.products.Products` is now ordered by name instead of by id.
