Hamza and I tried to use getlino for the first time on the new server for weleup.

- Released getlino 19.8.1

- sudo apt-get install python3-pip

  --> E: Repository 'http://ftp.be.debian.org/debian buster InRelease' changed its 'Suite' value from 'testing' to 'stable'

  --> apt-get update --allow-releaseinfo-change

- sudo -H pip3 install getlino

It says::

  Collecting getlino

    Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement getlino (from versions: )
  No matching distribution found for getlino

  "ping pypi.org" works

Maybe some problem with validating the server certificate  of pypi.org?
I tried the following, but without success::

  $ sudo -H pip3 --trusted-host pypi.org install getlino

After reading `this thread <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/5362>`__ I
decided to show this problem to Steve before trying further.
