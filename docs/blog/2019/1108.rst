"New ticket" instead of "Insert into All Tickets"
=================================================

I fixed :ticket:`3327`.
This was an unpaedagogic move because the ticket was introduced by newbie Amber who should have had the honour of working on it till the end.
But the idea is so good, and I couldn't wait having this in Lino... :-/
And we *would* have to wait because there are a few more issues that I would have to explain to Amber:

- Don't break virtual tables where :attr:`lino.core.actors.Actor.model` is None.
  This is just a theoretic possibility, I didn't yet find an example for it.

- The book test suite did *not* fail after this change. Which means that the
  code was not covered. The welfare suite however did fail. It's nothing new
  that the welfare test suite covers quite some functionalities which are not
  covered by the book.  I added two of these tests to the book so that the
  change is now covered (in :ref:`lino.specs.households` and :ref:`avanti.specs.avanti`).

- Don't forget to translate this to German and French because the change is
  quite visible and customers would complain otherwise.

- I am not sure but have a feeling that translation should use :func:`format_lazy`.
