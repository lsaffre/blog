Support Python 3 (by using feedgen instead of feedformatter)
============================================================

My sphinxfeed fork now works under Python 3
(continued from :doc:`0228`).

To generate the RSS feeds for my blogs I use
`sphinxfeed <https://github.com/lsaffre/sphinxfeed>`__.
Which uses feedformatter, which is dead.  So I had replace it.

There is Santiago Valdarrama's
`<GitHub <https://github.com/svpino/rfeed>`__, but
Lars Kiesow's https://feedgen.kiesow.be
`<GitHub <https://github.com/lkiesow/python-feedgen>`__
shows 31 contributors and last commit was in December 2018.

It was not fully trivial because the APIs differ quite much.  sphinxfeed now
needs dateutil to find the local timezone which is now required for generating
the RSS file.

Result: All my blogs are now being built under Python 3.


React front-end for Lino getting ready
======================================

The React front-end is now far enough to start using it.  There are still some
quirks, but for everyday work it is usable. We started using it on our
:ref:`noi` instance at https://hobbit.saffre-rumma.net

All references to tickets in this blog (made using :rst:role:`ticket`) now link
to hobbit instead of bugs.  This was just a setting in my :xfile:`conf.py`
file.

Before::

  extlinks.update(ticket=('http://bugs.saffre-rumma.net/tickets/Ticket/%s', '#'))

Now::

  extlinks.update(ticket=('https://hobbit.saffre-rumma.net/#/api/tickets/AllTickets/%s', '#'))
