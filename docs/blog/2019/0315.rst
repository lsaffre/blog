Support Python 3 (by using feedgen instead of feedformatter)
============================================================

My sphinxfeed fork now works under Python 3
(continued from :doc:`0228`).

To generate the RSS feeds for my blogs I use
`sphinxfeed <https://github.com/lsaffre/sphinxfeed>`__.
Which uses feedformatter, which is dead.  So I had replace it.

There is Santiago Valdarrama's
`<GitHub <https://github.com/svpino/rfeed>`__, but
Lars Kiesow's https://feedgen.kiesow.be
`<GitHub <https://github.com/lkiesow/python-feedgen>`__
shows 31 contributors and last commit was in December 2018.

It was not fully trivial because the APIs differ quite much.  sphinxfeed now
needs dateutil to find the local timezone which is now required for generating
the RSS file.
