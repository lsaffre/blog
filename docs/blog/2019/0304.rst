Congratulations to Hamza who released his work for :ref:`welcht` to their
production server. I just watched. This is a historical step for Lino: It is
the first time that another as I did a full development cycle on a customer
project, starting from analysis and communicating with the customer, doing the
code changes and docs, release the new version to the production site and
publish release notes for :ref:`welcht.19.3.0`.

Congratulations to Tonis who wrote a summary of our standup meeting today.  He
did this without being asked to do it.  That's hygge.

I am profoundly thankful for having these two assistants.  I wouldn't want to
continue Lino without if one them would leave.
