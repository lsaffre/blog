I discovered and fixed yet another bug introduced by my recent work on
:ticket:`3110`. Yes, the :meth:`lino.core.plugin.Plugin.get_detail_url` method
must also receive the incoming action request (I changed its signature), and
the renderer of the extjs plugin now returns a different URL depending on
whether ar.request is set or not: when calling it from
:meth:`send_summary_emails <lino_xl.lib.notify.Message.send_summary_emails>`
(e.g. ar.request is None), we want a "permalink" or "https:" URI. Otherwise we
want a "javascript:..." URI.

I continued on :ticket:`3036` and wrote a new command :cmd:`inv configure`.
This command is quite slow (it invokes :cmd:`pip install`
multiple times on each demo project), but that's not our primary concern on
travis.  The great thing is that we can soon remove all those tricky
requirement files and the :file:`install_requirements.sh` file.  And in the
developer√§s guide we can replace those complicated installation instruction by
an instruction to run :cmd:`inv configure`.

Adapted :ref:`atelier.changes`.
Released atelier to PyPI.
Adapted the :xfile:`.travis.yml` of book to use this new command.

There is a dependency hell around channels and redis in
:mod:`lino.modlib.notify`. I somehow got it to pass the test suite, but I
disabled :mod:`asgi_redis` completely.  Need to test it after release to jane
and hobbit.
