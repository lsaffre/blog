Django migrations
=================

This morning Tonis migrated :ref:`jane` into Django migrations (with Ivo and Luc
watching).

I started a new page in the Hosters Guide : :ref:`djangomig`.

Lino no longer works with "Django <2.2" but requires "Django>2.2". Which means
that we  will probably soon drop Python 2 support altogether. It's the year 2019
after all. I think we must now dare to say to our customers that their next
release will include the passage to Python 3, which includes the passage to
Debian 10 because Debian 9 comes with a rather old Python 3.

If you now run Lino in an environment with an old Django, you get quite quickly
the following error message::

  AttributeError: type object 'MigrationWriter' has no attribute 'register_serializer'

In that case you know that you must run::

  $ pip install -U Django

TODO:

- Rename :attr:`Site.migration_module` to :attr:`Site.migration_package`?

- Set :attr:`Site.migration_package` automatically when instantiating the :setting:`SITE`?
  Must *every* site have a  migration package? What about the demo projects?

- How to migrate a pre-19.8 Lino production site ?

- Is the old system (:ref:`lino.datamig`) still possible at all?



Lino Casa
=========

Lino Casa seems to be an interesting project for Ivo to learn.

The basic idea is to write a management software for apartment associations
(korteri√ºhistud).

- A table of appartments : each appartment has

   - an owner (a contacts.Parter) who gets invoices
   - a size in square meters which is used for cost distribution

- Automatically generate monthly sales invoices to all the owners.

Ivo will now talk to managers of such associations and ask them about their
needs and expectations regarding a new application.
