====================

I upgraded the avanti production server. Hamza watched me. I plan to ask them
soon whether they agree that Hamza becomes their dedicated developer.

The Python on their server is only 3.4. We should do ``sudo apt update`` before
migrating to Python 3. But this fails.  Has to do with the server hoster. I
must ask Valentin.  So we defer this part to a later time.

A manual change in the :xfile:`restore.py` file because cal.Event.priority is
now a choicelist field.

The pisa build method is being used in their database. Probably not
consciously.  As a quick fix I reactivated it locally in their
:mod:`lino.modlib.printing`. Difference between a plain CachedPrintable and
using Excerpts. For example cal.Entry should actually no longer inherit from
TypedPrintable. Just use excerpts.

Avanti no longer uses :mod:`lino_xl.lib.extensible`.

Bugfix: :mod:`lino_avanti.lib.avant.layouts` did not correctly hide the
CalendarView to teachers.

Released Avanti 19.5.0
