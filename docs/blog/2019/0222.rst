Mads Michael found his first Lino bug: Uploading files under Python 3 caused a
server error :message:`Exception Value: a bytes-like object is required, not
'str'` (:ticket:`2845`).
The problem was obviously in :meth:`handle_uploaded_files` of
:class:`lino.mixins.uploadable.Uploadable`.
I fixed it.
I tested only manually whether uploading a
file having non-ascii chars in its name works under both Python 2 and 3.
TODO: write a test case to cover this.

I realized that the "library files" feature was overkill for our case. MM and I
will probably not need this feature, I will simply forward incoming invoices to
him and he will enter them in Lino and then upload the file.

Both Hamza and Tonis missed our third stand-up meeting.  And I cannot even be
angry with them because who knows when it would happen to me.

I fixed :ticket:`2811` for Johanna.

I saw a typo in the the specs about :mod:`lino_xl.lib.cal` and started to
review the whole specs page.  I rebuilt the book.  And zack, one hour of
worktime was gone.
