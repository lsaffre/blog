Presto prototype getting ready
==============================

I installed the prototype for Presto on their site and plan to invite them soon
to the first visit.  This visit will be important for Lino, I don't want to
know what would happen if would fail (which won't happen of course ;-).

I released Lino and XL to PyPI (despite the fact that there are still failures
in the test suites).

I updated the German docs :ref:`presto.19.5.0` and :ref:`presto.de.tour`.

Some minor layout changes in :mod:`lino_presto.lib.contacts`.

Found some bugs: end_time, presto.Clients was showing only newcomer clients.


Difference between "Client" and "Customer"
==========================================

I read `this
<https://smallbusiness.chron.com/difference-between-customer-vs-client-56387.html>`__
and thought: Yes, that's what I felt when I chose "customer" and not "client"
in the ledger plugin. In the :mod:`lino_xl.lib.clients` plugin the clients are
even more specialized: they are humans (physical persons) and not
organizations.  There are businesses who call their customer "client" even
though it is an organization (e.g. lawyers), but we do not have such customers
at the moment.  Of course I'd say that the customers of Rumma & Ko are
long-term customers and have a profound and well-deserved "trust" in us, but
they remain organizations, not humans.



Customizing filter parameters
=============================

- setup_parameters is responsible for defining parameter fields
- param_defaults is responsible for setting default values for parameters
- get_request_queryset is responsible for translating the parameter values into a queryset

The methods can be defined either on the model or on a table.

An example is lino_xl.lib.ClientBase
