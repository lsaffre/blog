Fixed a bug in Così
===================

(1:20) Hamza and I discovered and fixed a little bug in :mod:`lino_xl.lib.vat`:
when you created an invoice in a journal with `edit_totals` and leave the total
field empty, Lino said "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -:
'NoneType' and 'Decimal'".  Also updated the :ref:`book.changes`.

Yes, I like what I did yesterday! We can now write change notes that (1) are
stored in the same repository as the code and (2) can refer to the
documentation.  For example the above bugfix and its change note is here:

https://github.com/lino-framework/xl/commit/18a88f2c01ce377d132e4c76ffb6e07b348d8e99


Reviewing intersphinx dependencies of the documentation trees
=============================================================

I finished my work on :ticket:`2806` (intersphinx dependencies of the
documentation trees).

The order of projects in your :xfile:`~/.atelier/config.py` has become more
important.  It must be (simplified summary)::

    blog atelier lino xl cosi ... book

Rule of thumb : project a must come before project b if

- code in a requires code in b to be installed
- docs of a want intersphinx references to docs of b

I can now run a full pp tour on my machine::

    $ pp -rv inv clean -b bd pd
    $ pp -v inv prep test

Also the change notes for Così  are now adapted to "the way I currently think
it should be": :ref:`cosi.changes`.



Setting up a new Così production site
=====================================

While setting up a new Così production site I had the following problem::

    mysql> grant all on rumma.* to django with grant option;
    ERROR 1558 (HY000): Column count of mysql.user is wrong. Expected 43, found 42. Created with MySQL 50562, now running 50642. Please use mysql_upgrade to fix this error.

After reading `this discussion on SO <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43846950/column-count-of-mysql-user-is-wrong-expected-42-found-44-the-table-is-probabl>`__
I tried::

    $ mysql_upgrade -uroot -p
