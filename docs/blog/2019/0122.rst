Fixed a bug in Cos√¨
===================

(1:20) Hamza and I discovered and fixed a little bug in :mod:`lino_xl.lib.vat`:
when you created an invoice in a journal with `edit_totals` and leave the total
field empty, Lino said "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -:
'NoneType' and 'Decimal'".  Also updated the :ref:`xl.changes`.

Yes, I like what I did yesterday! We can now write change notes that (1) are
stored in the same repository as the code and (2) can refer to the
documentation.  For example the above bugfix and its change note is here:

https://github.com/lino-framework/xl/commit/18a88f2c01ce377d132e4c76ffb6e07b348d8e99


Documentation review
====================

The order of projects in your :xfile:`~/.atelier/config.py` has become more
important.  It must be (simplified summary)::

    blog atelier lino xl cosi ... book

Project a must come before project b if

- code in a requires code in b to be installed
- docs of a want intersphinx references to docs of b

I can now run a full pp tour on my machine::

    $ pp inv prep test
    $ pp -rv inv clean -b bd pd
