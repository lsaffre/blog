=========================

I realized that we want, in :ref:`amici` multiple addresses for households and
organizations as well. So we no longer change
:attr:`lino_xl.lib.households.Plugin.partner_model` from its default value to
`contacts.Person`.

Which means that we must adapt the detail layouts for households and
organizations.  For the latter this is trivial because Amici already has a
custom contacts plugin.  But for households I had to choose: make a custom
plugin for amici just for overriding the detail layout? Sounds a bit of an
overkill.  So I decided to fix this by making :mod:`lino_xl.lib.households`
aware of :mod:`lino_xl.lib.addresses` and :mod:`lino_xl.lib.phones` : it now
provides a usable :class:`HouseholdDetail` when these two other plugins are also
installed.

I stumbled into a bug :ticket:`3429` (TypeError: must be str, not __proxy__).
Happened on a recurrent event with non-empty
:attr:`lino_xl.lib.cal.RecurrenceSet.positions` field and occurring on more than
one weekday.  Fixed the bug and added coverage in the :ref:`book.specs.cal`
doctest.
