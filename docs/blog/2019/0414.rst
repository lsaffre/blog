A marketing assistant in Belgium
================================

This week I invested again much time in our co-operation directive and other
activities which I'd classify as "talking about work" rather than "actually
working".  Lino is getting too big for me!  Let's hope that we will soon find a
`marketing assistant in Belgium <https://saffre-rumma.net/jobs/ma/>`__.
