========================

This weekend I have been working on the Developer Guide, trying to answer
Amber's questions.  It is getting better but there is still much to do.
I pushed my changes to master after the meeting.

Standup meeting
===============

Ivo, Tonis and I.

We had a brainstorming session about how Ivo and Amber should contribute. Should
we give them write access and let them push directly to master?
I updated the :ref:`team.howto.submit` page.
This weekend I read a joke on Reddit about pushing to master which I now mention on this page.

I would like Tonis to test his changes for callback under a multi-process nginx
as well. So we had a test session for getlino : use it to simulate a production
server on a contributor environment (another use case yet to be documented).
Together we experienced the aha effect of getting it running almost out of the
box.

This week Tonis will try to take over the following tasks :

- Review the Developer and the Contributor Guides so that it becomes useful for
  newbies like Amber and Ivo.  For example people are still falling into a "void
  space" when they finally managed to install their Lino environment.  Not sure
  whether it makes sense to start with the Django tutorial.

- Some more things to change in getlino (a quick list out of my head):

  - as suggested by Amber: make backup of files before overwriting them

  - as suggested by Amber: in a developer environment the value for host_name of a new site must be "localhost" and not "first.localhost".

  - sqlite database name should be "first.db" not just "first".

  - sqlite db file was not writable after installing a simulated production server.

  - Switch nginx back from single-process to multi, this is in the cookiecutter-startsite project
    :file:`{{cookiecutter.prjname}}/nginx/{{cookiecutter.prjname}}_uwsgi.ini`.

  - The nginx config files created by :cmd:`getlino startsite` are named
    PRJNAME/nginx/PRJNAME-something. No need to repeat the PRJNAME.

  - Should we stop having getlino use cookiecutter? Can't we just use Jinja
    directly? Cookiecutter seems overkill and introduces useless complexity.
    E.g. each new parameter needs to be declared in the
    :file:`cookiecutter.json` file although we don't need Cookiecutter in
    interactive mode at all.
