=======================

I moved :ref:`welfare` out of :ref:`book`.
I created a new repository :ref:`weleup`.
The welfare repo is now a library repo, similar to xl.


The welfare doctree does *not* contain any specs.
The specs for welfare plugins are in the doctrees of welcht or weleup.
That's because we have no demo project for welfare in general (and ATM we don't want to have one).

The API docs (autodoc) are in the doctree of the repo, together with the code.
That's different from xl whose API docs are in the book.

The :xfile:`__init__.py` files of welfare plugins can't refer directly to their
specs page because welfare is before weleup and welcht.

I moved :file:`man/welfare_de` to :file:`weleup/dedocs`.

The doctree of welcht refers to the doctree of weleup.

As a side effect I noticed that the :cmd:`diag` command did not yet work under
Python 3. Fixed. TODO: add a test case for it.
