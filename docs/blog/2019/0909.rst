I started working on :ticket:`2274` (some extensions asked by the :ref:`avanti`
:term:`site operator`).



- New option :attr:`lino_xl.lib.cv.Plugin.with_language_history`. If this is
  True, Lino adds a field  :attr:`LanguageKnowledge.obervation_date` and allows
  multiple entries per `(person, language)`. This can be used to record a
  history of the evolution of a person's language knowledge.
- Renamed the demo project :mod:`lino_book.projects.adg` to :mod:`lino_book.projects.avanti1`.
- In :mod:`lino_avanti.lib.avanti.settings`, replaced their usage of :meth:`lino.core.site.Site.setup_plugins` by :meth:`lino.core.site.Site.get_plugin_options`

- Reviewed the :xfile:`avanti/Client/final_report.body.html` template and started using it.
