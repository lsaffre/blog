I continued to review the :ref:`community` page and the README files of some
repositories (lino, xl and cosi).  I start to be satisfied for this time.


I registered myself at `people.djangoproject.com
<https://people.djangoproject.com/lucsaffre/>`__ where I found a name Erik
Allik who contributed to `culture.ee
<http://culture.ee/en/?fromdate=&todate=&locations=county-10&location_id=&organizer_or_artist_id=&query=>`__.
