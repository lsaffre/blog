===========================

Finally I took some time to repair the book test suite after my changes for
:ticket:`2776` last week.  There were now two classes named SSINChecker : one
in :mod:`lino_xl.lib.beid` and one in :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.pcsw`. I
renamed the SSINChecker in pcsw to IdentityChecker since it checks whether
there is an identifying document.  The name was wrongly given since it doesn't
validate the SSIN.

Tonis helped me to plan a new plugin :mod:`lino_xl.lib.files` (Manage external
files).  I wrote the specs.  But see tomorrow as well.
