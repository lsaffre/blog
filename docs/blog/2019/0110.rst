Some actions are duplicated
===========================

I fixed :ticket:`2784` (Some actions are duplicated).  The show action of
:class:`lino_welfare.modlib.integ.ActivityReport` was duplicated in
:attr:`Actor._actions_list` but nobody ever complained because it was not
visible. But since I wrote a test case in :ref:`welfare.specs.integ` which
verifies that the ticket is fixed, I must now do a release on PyPI to get the
test suite on :ref:`travis` passing again.

Before doing this I could maybe fix :ticket:`2785` as well.
I guess that the problem is in :mod:`lino.management.commands.initdb`.

Another idea (first mentioned by Hamza some days ago) is to have two more
environmens on Travis : one that uses the development versions of Lino and XL,
the other for the PyPI versions.  Which implies releasing also the book to
PyPI.
