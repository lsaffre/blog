I created :ticket:`3139` and worked on it. Note that when you installed getlino
with ``-e``, you must reinstall it after pulling this version to your local
copy.  See :ref:`getlino`.


Until now, we had to type "getlino.py ..." which is less beautiful than
"getlino ...".  This was because we used the `scripts` argument in
:xfile:`setup.py`.  I changed it to use `entry_points`. See `here
<https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command-line-scripts.html>`__.

Another advantage is that now we can write doctests about getlino. For example:

>>> from getlino.utils import APPNAMES
>>> print(APPNAMES)
['noi', 'voga', 'cosi', 'avanti', 'amici', 'presto', 'weleup', 'welcht', 'min2']

This advantage, however, is for later because currently we want the book test
suite to pass also on Python 2.

More advantages will come:

- we can write unit tests in the getlino repo, and we can probably get travis
  to setup complete production servers. We should take care to run those tests only
  on a virtual machine on travis, not on the machine of a developer.

- we can now use jinja templates in separate files for generating files.
  Especially for the bash_aliases this will be handy because there we will need
  more than Python's basic string formatting.


All those pips
==============

I had a problem on my machine: the following doesn't work::

    $ sudo pip3 install -e .
    sudo: pip3: command not found

Although I have python3-pip installed. I must say that I previously ran::

   $ sudo pip install -U pip

That is, I asked pip2 to upgrade itself.  Maybe this caused things to break.
Anyway, I fixed the problem by uninstalling both pips and re-installing just
pip3::

   $ sudo pip remove python-pip python3-pip
   $ sudo pip install python3-pip
