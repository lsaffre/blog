I worked in the :ref:`Administrator Guide <lino.admin>` and discovered that
getlino does not yet work with a shared database user. I opened :ticket:`3329`.
Side effect is that DB_ENGINES are no longer named tuples but real objects with
methods.

Now when I run :cmd:`inv prep` in :ref:`getlino`, I get::

  The command '/bin/sh -c sudo -H getlino configure --batch --db-engine postgresql --db-port 5432 && sudo -H getlino startsite --batch noi mysite1 --dev-repos "lino noi xl"' returned a non-zero code: 1

Note that  Lino's :manage:`install` command cannot install the Python package
required by the database engine. This is explicitly done by :cmd:`getlino
startsite`.  But if you run :cmd:`getlino startsite` with a given database
engine  and then manually change the :setting:`DATABASES` setting of your site,
you must yourself care about installing the corresponding Python package.
