Lino Presto
===========

Margarete reported a problem which shows that the
:class:`lino_xl.lib.cal.GuestsByPartner` table is not exactly what they need in
:ref:`presto`. Maybe neither in :ref:`avanti`. Clicking the (+) in the summary
of that table will try to create a new Guest. Which is nonsense here because it
asks you to select a calendar entry.

I wrote a new table :class:`lino_xl.lib.cal.EntriesByGuest`.

Both tables show "the calendar entries having the master instance as a guest".
But EntriesByGuest will create a new calendar entry. It also makes sure that it
has at least one guest, namely our master.  Because otherwise, if the user
creates an entry and forgets to manually add our master as a guest, they would
not see the new entry.

This required two optimizations in the core:

- New method :meth:`lino.core.dbtables.Table.after_create_instance`.

- Lino now supports a slave table whose
  :attr:`lino.core.actors.Actor.master_key` is a remote field.


Lino Welfare
============

I wrote a new data checker :class:`lino.modlib.system.BleachChecker`.

We will use this in :ref:`weleup` to make tests.  Since bleach was not yet
active for them until now, there might be unexpected side effects when a user
saves the database object.
