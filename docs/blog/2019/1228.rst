One possible explanation is that we have no DMARC record.
According to  `mxtoolbox.com <https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=mx%3alino-framework.org&run=toolpage#>`__.

On `zytrax.com <https://www.zytrax.com/books/dns>`__ I found valuable information:

A `DMARC record <https://www.zytrax.com/books/dns/ch9/dmarc.html>`__
is defined in the DNS file for our domain, i.e. at `zone.eu`.
It allows us to indicate to a mail receiver (e.g. hot.ee):

- the mechanisms used to authenticate its email (DKIM, SPF or both).

- how to handle mail that fails validity checks.

- Optionally request the receiver to send a feedback report, allowing the
  sender to analyze what's happening

IOW before writing a DMARC record I must setup SPF or DKIM.
DKIM is more complex than SPF, so I choose
`SPF <https://www.zytrax.com/books/dns/ch9/spf.html>`__.

The SPF information must be defined using a standard TXT resource record (RR)
that looks like this::

  name ttl  class TXT  "v=spf1 ..."

But what to put into that ``"v=spf1 ..."``?

Notes from `How to Build Your SPF Record in 5 Simple Steps
<https://www.validity.com/blog/how-to-build-your-spf-record-in-5-simple-steps/>`__:

  To protect your customers, your brand, and your business from phishing and
  spoofing attacks, you must authenticate your email. An SPF-protected domain is
  less attractive to fraudsters and is therefore less likely to be blacklisted by
  spam filters.

  Step 1 : identify which mail servers you use to send email from your domain.

  It is important to create SPF records for all the domains you control, even the
  ones youâ€™re not mailing from. Why? Because once you have protected your sending
  domains with SPF, the first thing a criminal will do is try to spoof your
  non-sending domains.


If I understand this page well, our SPF record is simply::

  name ttl  class TXT  "v=spf1 ip4:167.114.229.225 -all"

Actually this means that I add "v=spf1 ip4:167.114.229.225 -all" in the zone.eu
DNS file setup form at the right place.

Now for the DMARC1 record, this is another TXT record with the following
options::

  v=DMARC1; p=quarantine

Where `v=DMARC1` is mandatory and `p` must be either `none` or `quantine` or
`reject`. For documentation about the allowed tags in a DMARC record see
https://dmarc.org//draft-dmarc-base-00-01.html#iana_dmarc_tags

The actual zone file looks as follows::

  ; 2 TXT record(s)
  lino-framework.org.		IN	TXT	"v=spf1 ip4:167.114.229.225 -all"
  lino-framework.org.		IN	TXT	"v=DMARC1; p=quarantine"

When I first tried `mxtoolbox.com
<https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=mx%3alino-framework.org&run=toolpage#>`__
it still said "No DMARC Record found".  That's because it takes some time for
the DNS record to get replicated.

At a first attempt I said "v=DMARC1 p=none" instead of "v=DMARC1; p=none" and
mxtoolbox correctly reported a Syntax Error.

Oops, and I must probably say "v=spf1 ip4:167.114.229.225 ip4:193.70.18.144
-all" instead of "v=spf1 ip4:167.114.229.225 -all" because LF uses the ovh relay
server, so hot.ee receives my mail via this.
