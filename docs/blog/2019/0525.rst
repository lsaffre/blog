I continued fixing more failures on travis (:ticket:`881`).

I thought "Okay, let's try Visual Studio Code". Ouch, already their slogan on
the download page irritates me. It says "Free and built on open source".  In
other words, they insert the words "built on" into the expression "Free and
Open Source", which removes the original idea.  It is not open source, just
built on it. Then, in the `licence <https://code.visualstudio.com/license>`__ I
read that "This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software.
Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more
rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly
permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical
limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You
may not (...) share, publish, rent or lease the software (...) Result: Oh no,
that's not a licence I want to follow!  This is not a product I want to use.  I
don't want to support the company who produces it.
