I started a thorough review of :ref:`xl.specs.tickets`.

I renamed state "Started" to "Working"

:mod:`lino_xl.lib.tickets` had 'lino_noi.lib.noi' in `needed_plugins`.
Bullshit. Removed.

.. currentmodule:: lino_xl.lib.tickets

Renamed :class:`TicketsNeedingFeedback` to :class:`TicketsNeedingMyFeedback`.
And the labels of the two feedback tables are now more similar to the internal names.

TODO: Shouldn't :class:`MyTicketsNeedingFeedback` show only tickets assigned to
me?  To be observed.
