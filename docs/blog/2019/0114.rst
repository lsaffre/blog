========================

I worked on :ticket:`2789`.
They want a new client state "Informed" (more precisely German "Informiert").
The change was trivial (one more line in the
:xfile:`models.py` of :mod:`lino_avanti.lib.avanti`) and I did them a quick fix
with a change in their local copy of the code.

And then I did the same change in the master branch, this time using translated
text,  adapted the specs in (:ref:`avanti.specs.avanti`) and ran :command:`inv
mm` and :command:`poedit` in avanti to updating the translations.
