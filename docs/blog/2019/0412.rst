Congratulations to Tonis who started to write documentation! Actually this is
not hist first time, but it is the first time he wrote something for the
Developer's Guide: :ref:`dev.choosers`.  He also added prosa docs about
:ticket:`2953`:
:class:`lino_xl.lib.tickets.TicketsNeedingFeedback` and
:class:`lino_xl.lib.tickets.MyTicketsNeedingFeedback`

I added a section :ref:`related_master` in the page about
:ref:`slave_tables` (because I had this case yesterday for :ref:`presto`.
