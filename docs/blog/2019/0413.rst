Tickets waiting for feedback
============================

I started with end-user tests for :ticket:`2953`. Which is a difficult task for
me because there is so much to do!  The first "accident" happened quickly: I
started reviewing some pages of the developer's guide, and I moved
:file:`docs/dev/dumpy` to :file:`docs/dev/pyfixtures`.

The :class:`lino_xl.lib.tickets.TicketsNeedingFeedback` table is cool! This was
what I needed.  Notifications (instant messaging) is not a solution when you
have a lot of tickets which are not really urgent but wait for feedback.
Working through this list is part of triaging.

Pushed changes for Presto
=========================

I finished and checked in my work on :ref:`presto` (see :doc:`0411`).

The :class:`lino_xl.lib.cal.DailyPlanner` table is causing a failure in welfare
ATM.  I am not yet sure what required_roles this table should have. I think
that I will add CalendarReader to the user roles of the welfare usertypes admin
and 910.  I am not sure whether a Coordinator in Avanti should see this table.

The leap year bug
==================

Hamza fixed :ticket:`2946`.
The fix is confirmed by a failure in :ref:`welfare.specs.households`: Mr Ludwig
FRISCH (born 1968-06-01) was indeed 45 (not 46) years old on 2014-05-22.
