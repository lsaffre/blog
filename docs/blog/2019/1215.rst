I inserted FQDN and HOSTNAME instead of their real values::

  $ sudo apt update
  ...
  73 packages can be upgraded. Run 'apt list --upgradable' to see them.
  N: Repository 'https://mirrors.gandi.net/debian buster InRelease' changed its 'Version' value from '10.1' to '10.2'

  $ sudo apt upgrade

  $ sudo apt install postfix
  ...

  /etc/aliases does not exist, creating it.
  WARNING: /etc/aliases exists, but does not have a root alias.

  Postfix (main.cf) is now set up with a default configuration.  If you need to
  make changes, edit /etc/postfix/main.cf (and others) as needed.  To view
  Postfix configuration values, see postconf(1).

  After modifying main.cf, be sure to run 'service postfix reload'.

Install monit on Debian Buster::

  $ wget http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian/pool/main/m/monit/monit_5.26.0-3_amd64.deb
  ...
  $ sudo dpkg --install monit_5.26.0-3_amd64.deb
  Selecting previously unselected package monit.

  dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of monit:
   monit depends on libcrypt1 (>= 1:4.1.0); however:
    Package libcrypt1 is not installed.

  dpkg: error processing package monit (--install):

  $ sudo apt install libcrypt1
  Reading package lists... Done

  Reading state information... Done
  Package libcrypt1 is not available, but is referred to by another package.
  This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
  is only available from another source

  E: Package 'libcrypt1' has no installation candidate

Maybe it is easier to wait until monit has made it into stable. When can I
expect this to happen?  Maybe soon, because some days ago it has been accepted
to unstable:

 [2019-12-12] Accepted monit 1:5.26.0-3 (source) into unstable (Sergey B Kirpichev)
