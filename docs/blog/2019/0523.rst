Now that :ticket:`3010` is fixed, I might upgrade their production server so
that they see it.  But Johanna said it is not about a few days.  So I try to
get the test suites passing on :ref:`travis` before updating their server.
(IOW I work for :ticket:`881`)

I fixed a failure `SyntaxError: 'return' with argument inside generator
<https://travis-ci.org/lino-framework/book/jobs/535972619>`__ under Python 2.
Though I didn't understand why I could not reproduce it locally.

I updated the system requirements section (:file:`include/system_req.rst`)
which was still recommending Python 2.

The :ref:`dev.install` page now uses the :xfile:`install_dev_projects.sh`
script to automatically install all Lino repositories
