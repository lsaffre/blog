======================

Hamza and I were glad to have the production upgrade done and the release notes
published, but there is more to do: the technical documentation and the test
suite (:ref:`specs`) needs to be updated.

These specs are currently in the book repository.
Also those which are specific to :ref:`welcht`.

But before doing so, I must do another step of reorganizing these specs and
move them to the welcht repository.  As a consequence the ``mathieu`` demo
project moves to :mod:`lino_welcht.demo` (is no longer needed in the book, and
it is now needed for testing the specs in welcht).

The following references should now work:

- :ref:`welcht.specs` (the specs for welcht)
- :ref:`welcht.about` (the about page for welcht)
- :mod:`lino_welcht` (the API)

Note that we need to decide for every doctree who is the "maintainer" or
"publisher".  The maintainer of a doctree is the person who runs :cmd:`inv pd`,
which rsyncs his local copy to :file:`/home/xxx/public_html/yyy_zzz` on
:ref:`lf` where xxx is the username, yyy is the project's nickname and zzz is
the name of the doctree within the project.

There are two doctrees in welcht :

- docs (technical docs in English)
- frdocs (the French docs)

Hamza is already the maintainer for frdocs (we configured Apache to serve
/home/hamza/public_html/welcht_frdocs to fr.welfare.lino-framework.org), but I
am (currently)  still the maintainer of the technical welcht docs.  We will
make Hamza the maintainer of these as well as soon as I explained all this to
him.
