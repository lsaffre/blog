Hamza and I were glad to have the production upgrade done and the release notes
published, but there is more to do: the technical documentation and the test
suite (:ref:`specs`) needs to be updated.

These specs are currently in the book repository.
Also those which are specific to :ref:`welcht`.

Before doing so, I think we need another step of reorganizing these specs and
move them to the welcht repository.
