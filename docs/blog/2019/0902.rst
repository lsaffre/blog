RuntimeError: populate() isn't reentrant
=========================================

Hobbit was not responding, the apache error log said::

  mod_wsgi (pid=18156): Exception occurred processing WSGI script '/usr/local/python/lino_sites/hobbit/apache/wsgi.py'.
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "/usr/local/python/lino_sites/hobbit/apache/wsgi.py", line 13, in <module>
      from lino_local import setup_wsgi ; setup_wsgi(globals())
    File "/usr/local/python/lino_local.py", line 21, in setup_wsgi
      globals_dict.update(application = get_wsgi_application())
    File "/mnt/disk/jane/env3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/django/core/wsgi.py", line 12, in get_wsgi_application
      django.setup(set_prefix=False)
    File "/mnt/disk/jane/env3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/django/__init__.py", line 24, in setup
      apps.populate(settings.INSTALLED_APPS)
    File "/mnt/disk/jane/env3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/django/apps/registry.py", line 83, in populate
      raise RuntimeError("populate() isn't reentrant")
  RuntimeError: populate() isn't reentrant

The problem vanished after running :xfile:`reload_services.sh`. This sporadic
:message:`populate() isn't reentrant` error is a bit mysterious. Might be
related to Apache's mod_wsgi, so maybe it will vanish when we move to nginx.

Supervisor failing on SR
========================

While Apache now restarted without problem, supervisor reports an error.  The
supervisor log file says::

  CRIT Supervisor running as root (no user in config file)

After reading
`here <https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/308>`__
and `here <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13905861/supervisor-as-non-root-user>`_
I'd say that we can ignore this warning.
But the error message is still coming.

I saw another warning in `sudo journalctl -xe`::

    Sep 02 01:11:01 ovh2 cron[20502]: (*system*certbot) WRONG FILE OWNER (/etc/cron.d/certbot)

And indeed the file was owned by tonis. So I said::

  $ sudo chown root:root /etc/cron.d/certbot

But the error message is still coming.
I saw that `sudo systemctl status supervisor.service` said::

  Sep 02 01:16:58 ovh2 systemd[1]: supervisor.service: Found left-over process 11154 (soffice.bin) in control group while starting unit. Ignoring.
  Sep 02 01:16:58 ovh2 systemd[1]: This usually indicates unclean termination of a previous run, or service implementation deficiencies.
  Sep 02 01:16:58 ovh2 systemd[1]: supervisor.service: Found left-over process 11160 (python) in control group while starting unit. Ignoring.
  Sep 02 01:16:58 ovh2 systemd[1]: This usually indicates unclean termination of a previous run, or service implementation deficiencies.
  Sep 02 01:16:58 ovh2 systemd[1]: Starting LSB: Start/stop supervisor...
  Sep 02 01:16:59 ovh2 supervisor[18340]: Starting supervisor: Error: Another program is already listening on a port that one of our HTTP servers is configured to use.  Shut
  Sep 02 01:16:59 ovh2 supervisor[18340]: For help, use /usr/bin/supervisord -h
  Sep 02 01:16:59 ovh2 systemd[1]: supervisor.service: Control process exited, code=exited, status=2/INVALIDARGUMENT
  Sep 02 01:16:59 ovh2 systemd[1]: supervisor.service: Failed with result 'exit-code'.
  Sep 02 01:16:59 ovh2 systemd[1]: Failed to start LSB: Start/stop supervisor.

I guess that a reboot might be a simple workaround for this time, so I did::

  $ sudo reboot

Indeed now :xfile:`reload_services.sh` reports no error.  Except for a warning
which says "Forcefully stopping supervisor: supervisord." which I ignore for
this time.

I also saw that the :file:`/var/log/supervisor/supervisord.log` file was very
big because we don't rotate it. So I created a file
:file:`/etc/logrotate.d/supervisor`.

getlino doesn't configure logrotate
====================================

I opened and fixed :ticket:`3179`.
It seems that monit creates its own logrotate config file.
