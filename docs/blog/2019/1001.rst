I worked a bit on our community guide (:ref:`cg`).

I saw that Hamza had tried to fix :ticket:`3239` and realized that the docs
about :envvar:`LINO_CACHE_ROOT` were insufficient.  He had no chance to find the
easy solution.  Indeed we have two demo projects
:mod:`lino_book.projects.polls` and :mod:`lino_book.projects.polls2` which cause
a name clash when :envvar:`LINO_CACHE_ROOT` is used. The simple solution was to
manually set a :attr:`lino.core.site.Site.project_name` for the second `mysite`
site.

But why did this problem occur only now? The :mod:`polls2
<lino_book.projects.polls2>` demo project is quite old, isn't it? And
:envvar:`LINO_CACHE_ROOT` is used on :ref:`travis` already a long time, isn't
it?
