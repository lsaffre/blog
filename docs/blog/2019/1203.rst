I had a look at the Lino book using my mobile phone, imagining somebody who does
not yet know Lino and tries to evaluate the project.  The first stumblestone was
that the default sphinx theme (used by all sites) is not really mobile-friendly.
I asked Google and found `sphinx_rtd_style
<https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__.
Atelier now installs this as theme on all our sites.
