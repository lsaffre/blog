I stumbled into what looks like a regression on the `cosi1e online demo
<https://cosi1e.lino-framework.org>`__. I sign in as robin and then click on the
"749 Sales invoices (SLS)" in the dashboard, ... but nothing happens. Or more
precisely the JS console says::

  Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: n is undefined
    computeDefaults NavigationControl.js:289
    _ NavigationControl.js:572
    pushPath NavigationControl.js:731
    runAction ActionHandler.tsx:739
    checkAndRunAction ActionHandler.tsx:688
    runAction App.jsx:559
    <anonymous> :1
  NavigationControl.js:289:47
    pushPath NavigationControl.js:731
    AsyncFunctionThrow self-hosted:804
    (Async: async)
    runAction ActionHandler.tsx:739
    InterpretGeneratorResume self-hosted:1413
    AsyncFunctionNext self-hosted:800
    (Async: async)
    checkAndRunAction ActionHandler.tsx:688
    runAction App.jsx:559
    <anonymous> :1

The URL under the "749 Sales invoices (SLS)" text in the dashboard is::

  javascript:window.App.runAction({ "actorId": "trading.InvoicesByJournal",
  "an": "grid", "rp": null, "status": { "base_params": { "mk": 1, "mt": 23 },
  "param_values": { "cleared": null, "clearedHidden": null, "end_period": null,
  "end_periodHidden": null, "partner": null, "partnerHidden": null,
  "start_period": null, "start_periodHidden": null, "state": null,
  "stateHidden": null } } })

I had a look at the mentioned source code :file:`App.jsx` and
:file:`ActionHandler.tsx` (both are in
:file:`react/lino_react/react/components`).

Then I discovered that the problem doesn't occur on my machine. NB: of course I
had hit :kbd:`Shift+Ctrl+R` before starting to investigate. So I cleared the
cookies and site data for the online demo site, signed in again, hit
:kbd:`Shift+Ctrl+R` once more, and the issue was gone.

So I just stumbled into a situation where Lino does not automatically detect
that the :term:`site data` needs to get cleared.
