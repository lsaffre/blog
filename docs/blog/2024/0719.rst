Today I ran :cmd:`inv mm` in ``lino``, obviously for the first time since
20240521, because the Spanish :xfile:`.po` file was broken, it contained
hundreds of Git conflict markers. I guess that something went wrong with  `Joy's
first commit
<https://gitlab.com/lino-framework/lino/-/commit/44f64dda14f7d064f8427f0a1fb126d1274421fa#63629fb67b675cc4d641c374585fa18505d2a739>`__.

I wrote a little Python script to remove the second part of every chunk:

.. literalinclude:: remove_git_markers.py
