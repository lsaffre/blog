Yesterday I sent a next newsletter to my friends.   I manage the recipient list
in Thunderbird and set it as the bcc field (because we don't want everybody to
see the other recipients).

My list holds 375 addresses, 43 of which are at ``skynet.be``. And Skynet (which
is now a part of Proximus) accepts a maximum number recipients per connection.
After the 5th recipient it says "Too many recipients". But the Postfix on our
mail server doesn't give up. It tries again after 5 minutes, then after ten
minutes, after 20 minutes... Here is how that looks in the :file:`mail.log` file::

  $ sudo grep joe.doe /var/log/mail.log
