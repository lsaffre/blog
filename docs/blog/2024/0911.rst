I have a copy of my data, made with :cmd:`rsync` and using the ``-a`` option::

 --archive, -a            archive mode is -rlptgoD (no -A,-X,-U,-N,-H)

How restore my data do my new notebook computer? I'd like to keep all
permissions. But of course the new computer has different values for UID and
GID. I would have to do some mapping.
