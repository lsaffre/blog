===================================
Alvatal moved from GitHub to GitLab
===================================

Thursday, May 30, 2024

The `alvatal.ee <https://www.alvatal.ee>`__ website is now hosted on GitLab.

Alvatal, short for "Estonian Free and Open-Source Software Association" is a
non-profit umbrella organization for Estonian open-source and free software
initiatives.

Alvatal is led by `Edmund Laugasson <https://edmund.laugasson.net/>`__ who
dedicated many years of his life as full-time activist helping deciders to opt
for FOSS and companies to offer professional services.

The website is made using `Jekyll <https://jekyllrb.com/>`__.
Lauri VÃµsandi created it in December 2014 and maintained it until
September 2016 (`initial commit
<https://github.com/alvatal/alvatal.github.io/commit/a61aaa7d73b0fa8ae759a08d48ef937a78468985>`__).

- Website: https://www.alvatal.ee
- Project page on GitLab: https://gitlab.com/alvatal/www

Hashtags:

At least one problem is still open: the present blog post does not appear in the
`news section <https://www.alvatal.ee/en/news/>`__ even though I added my blog
to the `planet_en.yml
<https://gitlab.com/alvatal/www/-/blob/master/planet_en.yml?ref_type=heads>`__
file and GitLab `reports
<https://gitlab.com/alvatal/www/-/jobs/6981067570#L1034>`__ "Parsing
https://luc.lino-framework.org/rss.xml". But then ignores all blog posts, even
the last one, which starts with "Alvatal", which is defined as a keyword in
`whitelisted_tags`.

I converted my newsfeed xml generator (`sphinxfeed
<https://github.com/lsaffre/sphinxfeed>`__) to generate `ATOM
<https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/atom.html>`__ instead of RSS (a task for
which I had to read the docs and the code of `feedgen
<https://feedgen.kiesow.be/>`__), but that too didn't fix the issue.

Right now i do not know any further...
