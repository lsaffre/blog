===================================================
Grid cells don't start editing when I click on them
===================================================

Saturday, August 17, 2024

The :cmd:`npm run build` command now works as expected, I made some easy changes
and can see the resulting behaviour in the version built on my machine. Here are
my first changes:

- In :file:`components/ActionHandler.tsx` I changed the message "No modified
  data detected!", replacing the exclamation mark ("!") by a period ("."). I
  also ran :cmd:`npm run mm`, which caused the files
  below :file:`lino_react/translations/extracts/i18n` to get updated.

- In :file:`components/AppInlineProfile.jsx` and :file:`components/constants.js`
  I removed the "Pinned URL(s)" button and related code. Sharif had added this
  feature recently, but I don't like it. The basic idea is great, but I believe
  that we should implement it on the server side and store the pinned urls in
  the database.

But I am having yet another riddle before I can say that I understood how to
build the :term:`React front end`. One detail is broken: the grid cell editor
doesn't start when I click on a cell.  I even undid my easy changes and returned
back to exactly the source code as in the gitlab repo, but the grid cell remains
unimpressed by my mouse clicks. No message in the JS console.
