===================

New or updated rules.

Lino no longer tests for ``if s.startswith("<")`` for deciding whether a string
``s`` contains safe html. If you don't want it to get escaped, you must mark it
as safe using :func:`mark_safe`.

TODO: Rename `Model.as_summary_row` to `Model.as_summary_item`

:meth:`Model.as_paragraph` should include a link to the detail. Lino no longer
adds such a link automatically in certain places. (:meth:`add_detail_link` has
been removed).
