Having no news from Sharif (see :doc:`0802`) is a good reason for me to
seriously dive into React, npm, webpack, jest and all these tools.

I still didn't get :cmd:`npm run build` to execute (see :doc:`0729`), so I tried
to grasp the problem from the roots: I read a series of basic introductions to
React and JSX:

- `Learn React > Quick Start <https://react.dev/learn>`__

- `Writing Markup with JSX <https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx>`__

- `JavaScript in JSX with Curly Braces <https://react.dev/learn/javascript-in-jsx-with-curly-braces>`__

- The `export <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export>`__ declaration.

- `Export and Import <https://javascript.info/import-export>`__

What I don't understand: How does a browser "know" whether a script is written
in JSX and not in plain JavaScript?


The story continues on :doc:`0806`.
