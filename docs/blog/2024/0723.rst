Jason Cook made yet another `pull request for sphinxfeed
<https://github.com/lsaffre/sphinxfeed/pull/9>`__, which I accepted.
Jason has obviously more experience with pytest than me.

When I was exploring the :class:`sphinx.testing.utils.SphinxTestApp`, I stumbled
into the following comment::

  # see https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/12089 for the
  # discussion on how the signature of this class should be used

I have a problem with this because it because it causes a part of the Sphinx
documentation to be copyrighted by GitHub. It triggers my :term:`Daniel
syndrome`.
