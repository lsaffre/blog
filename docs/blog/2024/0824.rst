Today I pushed my first changeset in lino-react. I also released this to PyPI.

My first changeset in lino-react

Detailed list of changes:

- Updated the docs so that they build again with :cmd:`inv bd`. Some
  time ago we tried to use sphinxjs, but that turned out to not work as
  easily as expected, and now I boldly decided to try documenting in
  prosa style.

- Removed the "Pinned URL(s)" button in the toolbar of the main page.

- Changed the "!" into a "." in a translatable text message (mostly to
  test i18n).

- In `<GridElement>`, the logic for finding the next cell to edit
  when a cell editor has finished, is no longer run by the `onKeyDown`
  event of the wrapper div but by the `onCellEditComplete` hook of the
  `<DataTable>`.

- Bump primereact version from 10.6 to 10.8.2. (Add `editMode`
  attribute to `<DataTable>`)
