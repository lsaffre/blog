========================

I found and fixed another bug in :mod:`lino_xl.lib.vat`:  Now that we inverted
the booking direction of :term:`returnable VAT`, it's the vat_account of a VAT
rule (not the returnable_vat_account) that must be optional. And as a
consequence we do not need the separate returnable_vat boolean any more.

The :meth:`lino_xl.lib.ledger.PeriodRange.get_period_filter` now automatically
adds a filter to ignore preliminary movements when a starting period is given.
Note that this required a change to the method's signature.

There were two bugs in :mod:`lino_book.projects.chatter` : :ticket:`3460` and
:ticket:`3462`.

I opened and did :ticket:`3459` (Move calendar view from "cal" to a separate
plugin :mod:`lino_xl.lib.calview`).

One consequence for data migration: DailyPlannerRow has moved from cal to calview

En passant I removed Python 2 code whenever I saw it.
