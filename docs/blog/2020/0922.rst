I had the following on my old notebook (`doll`)::

  error: no such partition.
  Entering rescue mode...
  grub rescue>

::

  grub rescue> set

  prefix=(hd0,msdos6)/boot/grub
  root=hd0,msdos6

  grub rescue> ls
  (hd0) (hd0,msdos2) (hd0,msdos1) (hd1) (hd1,msdos1)
  grub rescue> ls (hd0,msdos2)
  (hd0,msdos2): Filesystem is unknown
  grub rescue> ls (hd1,msdos1)
  (hd1,msdos1): Filesystem is ext2

  grub rescue> set boot=(hd1,msdos1)
  grub rescue> set prefix=(hd1,msdos1)/boot/grub

::

  grub rescue> insmod normal
  error: file `/boot/grub/i386-pc/normal.mod' not found.

When I specified some of the other partitions in boot and prefix, it says::

  grub rescue> insmod normal
  error: no such partition

And in both cases the following says::

  grub rescue> normal
  Unknown command `normal'.

Funny:  I created an Lubuntu install usb, then changed the book order: move "USB
device" one item up in order to book from the usb, but then I didn't need the
usb stick because it booted into initram where I simply said "fsck /dev/sda1"
(as instructed), then said ENTER to every "fix?" question, and afterwards
everything was back...
