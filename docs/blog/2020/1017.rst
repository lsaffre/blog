The :ref:`mentori` test suite is still  `failing on GitLab
<https://gitlab.com/lino-framework/mentori/-/jobs/796405040>`__. Obviously the
environment there still uses a version of the xl where
:mod:`lino_xl.lib.courses` still declares :mod:`lino_xl.lib.cal` as a
dependency. Did I forget to release the xl to PyPI? Let's try::

  $ go xl
  $ git status
  On branch master
  Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
  nothing to commit, working tree clean
  $ inv sdist release
  ...
  ABORT: lino-xl 20.10.0 has already been released.


Aris had a few questions about the source code of :ref:`mentori`. This made me
understand that the :xfile:`README.rst` of a Lino application (i.e. also in
:ref:`algus`) should explain in a few sentences where to find the entry point.
Because at the moment it is quite intimidating, even for an experienced Django
site admin, to try to understand the code repository of a Lino application.
