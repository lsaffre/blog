I sent an email from luc.saffre@gmx.net to toimetus@laudate.ee, which is a
simple alias that goes to 6 addresses.  The mail is being forwarded to the
recipients, but one of them reported that my mail was marked as junk.

I observed that indeed opendkim on laudate.ee did not sign the incoming email:

  Jul 28 21:30:32 laudate opendkim[722]: 93C573FFFF: mout.gmx.net [212.227.15.15] not internal
  Jul 28 21:30:32 laudate opendkim[722]: 93C573FFFF: not authenticated
  Jul 28 21:30:32 laudate opendkim[722]: 93C573FFFF: no signing domain match for 'gmx.net'
  Jul 28 21:30:32 laudate opendkim[722]: 93C573FFFF: no signing subdomain match for 'gmx.net'
  Jul 28 21:30:32 laudate opendkim[722]: 93C573FFFF: s=badeba3b8450 d=gmx.net SSL

That's actually normal. Anybody might send spam to toimetus@laudate.ee and
laudate.ee would forward it to these recipients.

So the /etc/aliases file must not be used as a simple forwarding to external
mail recipients.
