I saw that :meth:`Plannable.get_weekly_chunks`,  :meth:`Model.summary_row` and
:meth:`cal.Event.get_event_summary` are doing very similar things: return a
"formatted" representation of a calendar entry to be used "in a calendar cell"
(i.e. without date and time because these are assumed to be given by other
elements). We want to customize how calendar entries are "interpreted".  It
makes sense to do this in a method of the Event model.  The context may be
important, e.g. in certain views we want the name of the workers to show here,
in other views not. To be meditated.
