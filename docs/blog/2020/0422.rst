I investigated about :ticket:`3602`. Yes, the new Avanti had a new button
ToggleState on :class:`courses.Course`. And clicking on that button produced a
user warning "type object 'CourseStates' has no attribute 'registered'" (but
otherwise did nothing).

Indeed this was a relatively harmless design flaw:
:class:`lino_xl.lib.cal.Reservation` was inheriting from
:class:`lino.mixins.registrable.Registrable`.  There was no reason for this.  At
least I couldn't find one.  I removed the base class and the
:meth:`get_registrable_fields <lino.mixins.registrable.Registrable.get_registrable_fields>` method.

EDIT: If you believe above explanation, then you are as wrong as I were. See
:doc:`0423`.
