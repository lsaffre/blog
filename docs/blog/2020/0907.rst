Today I finished :ref:`dev.lets.step4` of the :ref:`dev.lets`.

user_roles now computed dynamically by :class:`lino.modlib.users.UserRoles` (no
longer stored in the Site (and initialized at startup in
:mod:`lino.core.kernel`). Optimized the algorithm for deciding which roles are
meaningful.  Removed the number of roles from analyzer.get_complexity_factors.

Removed the roles defined in :mod:`lino.modlib.office.roles` from
:mod:`lino.core.user_types`.  I plan to move the office plugin to :ref:`xl` one
day.
