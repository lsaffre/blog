I finished :ticket:`3810`:  In :mod:`lino_xl.lib.sheets`, the reports now have
columns "Balance before" and "Balance after" instead of "Debit before", "Credit
before", "Debit after" and "Credit after". Fixed some bugs that caused the
report to not show all totals.

This was fun, complex and difficult to explain because very specific accounting
stuff.  I plan to write more documentation when :ticket:``


I added a new :term:`django-admin command` :manage:`showsettings` and started a new
documentation page for :ref:`specs.jinja`.
