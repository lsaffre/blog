Filtering the workers.

The easiest way is to have for each journal a list of the potential workers.
The journals would be the equivalent of teams.
We would add only one model  `lino_presto.lib.contacts.Membership`
that links a `contacts.Worker` to a `ledger.Journal`.

A bit more sophisticated would be a separate model for storing teams. Per
journal a pointer to the team, and per team a list of its workers.
