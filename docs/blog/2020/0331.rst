Today I worked on printing an order in :ref:`presto` (as part of
:ticket:`3477`).

Added a custom template to the presto1 project.

But how to configure the signer? Something like in welfare, but probably just a
pointer to a  :class:`contacts.Role`.  This is a ticket on its own:
:ticket:`3569`.  New model :class:`contacts.Signer`.
