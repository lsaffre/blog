Customized calendar views
=========================

Uff! Seems that I can finally publish my work for :ticket:`3502` (Customized
calendar views). The :mod:`lino_presto.lib.contacts` plugin is our first usage
example.  It introduces a second "navigator" which, unlike the default navigator
shows the workers instead of the time slots as the rows of the weekly and daily
views. The new workers navigator has no monthly view because that wouldn't make
sense.

Here is a summary of my manual test suite:

- team : check whether WorkedHours is being displayed in the dashboard and contains data.
  robin didn't work, so he has no hours, but the table is there because it is not empty.
  robin acting as jean would have some hours
- lydia : a standard calendar view with events.
- noereth : here we have two "calendar view" entries in the Calendar menu.
- mathieu : is the daily planner in the dashboard?

For each calendar view : check whether insert buttons are at the right place and
open a correct insert dialog. Check whether clicking on an event opens that event.
Check whether navigation works in general.


TODO:

- rename DailyPlannerRow model to TimeSlot?
- write documentation
- Workers calendar in presto has no monthly view, so the month header should not have a
  popup div for selecting another month
- customize the title tags of individual calendar entries
- customize the text to show per event
- switch between the two Navigators (e.g. from the general weekly view in a
  given week to the workers view in that same week)
