I continued working on :ticket:`3695`. Two final little changes:

.. currentmodule:: lino_xl.lib.uploads

- :class:`MyExpiringUploads` is now a dashboard item. In
  avanti1 you can sign in as user Nathalie to have an example in your dashboard.
  The demo data has two expiring upload files for client 114.  You can then
  change the primary coach of that client and see that the expiring upload files
  are now in the dashboard of that user, no longer in Nathalie's dashboard.

- Two new settings :attr:`Plugin.expiring_start` and :attr:`Plugin.expiring_end`
  because I guess that the current default values 0 and 365 don't match their
  needs.


The last build of the book on travis
(`1940 <https://travis-ci.org/github/lino-framework/book/builds/702647361>`__)
is still failing::

  File "/home/travis/build/lino-framework/book/docs/specs/cosi/apc.rst", line 312, in apc.rst
  Failed example:
      print(rt.find_config_file("logo.jpg", "weasyprint"))  #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
  Expected:
      /.../lino_book/projects/apc/settings/config/weasyprint/logo.jpg
  Got:
      /home/travis/virtualenv/python3.6.10/src/lino-xl/lino_xl/lib/sales/config/weasyprint/logo.jpg

This is not a missing ellipsis.  Seems that Lino doesn't find the local config
dir when running on travis. Maybe because lino_cache is being used.
