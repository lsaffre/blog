Tickets :ticket:`1985` is not yet fully done. Debtors and Creditors in welfare
now have 0 and 15 rows instead of 5 and 10 rows. Maybe we need to adapt these
two lists: maybe when using cascaded clearing we must say more precisely what a
"debitor" and "creditor" means. We must somehow be able to say that we want only
certain type of credit.

An AAW does the following:
- credits 4450 (Disbursement orders to execute)
- debits 832/330/01 (Allgemeine Beihilfen)

Or maybe the problem is simply that both movements are booked to the partner.
The debit movement into the costs account (832/330/01) should not have
:attr:`partner` set because the cost account does not require clearing.

None of the monthly AAW movements is cleared by a ZKBC. Maybe because the
booking dates are wrong? I fiddled for more than an hour but could not find a
definitive explanation. To be continued when a customer shows interest.
