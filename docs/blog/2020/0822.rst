Ismail reported the following error when setting
:attr:`default_ui <lino.core.site.Site.default_ui>` to :mod:`lino_openui5.openui5`::

  [18/Aug/2020 01:58:12] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 500 99629
  Internal Server Error: /
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    File ".../lino/venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/jinja2/loaders.py", line 429, in load
      raise TemplateNotFound(name)
  jinja2.exceptions.TemplateNotFound: openui5/main.html


Yes, I can reproduce the problem in a contributor environment as follows:

  1) uninstall the dev version and install the pip version of lino_openui5

  2) run the following::

      go cms
      nano settings/__init__.py
      # change default_ui  from 'lino_react.react' to 'lino_openui5.openui5'
      runserver
      # do a browser request

It must be a packaging problem since it works with the dev version.

Indeed there is no :xfile:`MANIFEST.in`  in the :ref:`openui5` repository.

I added a :xfile:`MANIFEST.in` and released version 20.8.1 to PyPI. But I didn't
test locally before releasing to PyPI. It turned out that I had forgotten to
include the json files. So I needed a second release 20.8.2.  With this one it
works.
