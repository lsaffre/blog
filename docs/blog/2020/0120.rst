I realized that Lino doesn't yet generate annual closings (Profit/Loss
declarations) and opened :ticket:`3476`.  At the moment, we would have to make a
manual misc transaction that  puts the balance of all costs and incomes accounts
back to 0 at the end of a fiscal year.

As a first step I opened and did :ticket:`3475` (Make Declaration a mixin in ledger):
The current VAT declaration contains functionality that we will also want for
income declarations and employment declarations.  Their common logic is to
"observe" a given period range.

As a side effect, the :class:`lino_xl.lib.accounting.Payable` mixin had to move from
sepa to ledger.  Which makes sense and confirms the idea.
