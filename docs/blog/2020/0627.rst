Miscellaneous
=============

I started to work on :ticket:`3465` and added courses to :ref:`amici`.
En passant I renamed :mod:`lino_amici.projects.herman` to :mod:`lino_amici.projects.amici1`.

Six releases to PyPI (all with version 20.6.0) : Lino, XL, :ref:`react`,
:ref:`amici`, :ref:`avanti` and :ref:`presto`.


Lino enters a new level
=======================

Today is yet another historic day for Lino.
I started to formulate the big news: :doc:`0628`.
It is yet another example of how the
big decisions in my life are actually not my own decisions; they seem to come
from outside and I just pronounce them.  I announced the news internally to
Tonis and Hamza on Thursday morning, and today I got their confirmations: we
are ready for the next level.
