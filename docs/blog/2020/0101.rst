In :mod:`atelier.invlib.tasks` there was a bug causing a traceback under Python
3 when creating the first entry of a new year.  I fixed this, and also removed
two places where it says::

      if six.PY2:
          content = content.encode('utf-8')

I removed these additional tests, and dependency to `six`.


I had a traceback::

  File ".../site-packages/localflavor/generic/checksums.py", line 2, in <module>
    from django.utils import six

  ImportError: cannot import name 'six' from 'django.utils' (.../site-packages/django/utils/__init__.py)`

Which I fixed using::

  $ pip install -U django-localflavor
