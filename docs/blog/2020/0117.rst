Make lino-book installable via pip
===================================

`This failure <https://travis-ci.org/lino-framework/presto/builds/638048589>`__
has been there for a while already, seems that I must take it::

  ERROR: Packages installed from PyPI cannot depend on packages which are not also hosted on PyPI.
  lino-book depends on django-mailbox@ git+https://github.com/cylonoven/django-mailbox

Yes, Presto's travis file installs the book using pip.  No normal guy wants that
because the purpose of the book is to explain and test.

But the presto docs are a first case of something that seems normal:
a package not covered by the book, and whose docs
do intersphinx links to the book.
The lino_presto package itself
doesn't require lino_book to be installed.
But Sphinx gets the URL of the book by importing it
and asking for its :envvar:`intersphinx_url`.
We what to have that URL in a central place.
I don't see any better way.

So I moved the django-mailbox dependency from the book's :xfile:`setup_info.py`
to :file:`requirements-include.txt`.  Also had to release a new PyPI version of
the book, of course.

Note that the current approach doesn't check whether we have a local clone of
Tonis' django-mailbox, and that this git repo isn't managed by `getlino
configure --clone`.  I am not sure whether this is a problem.
