OpenUI5 on Travis
=================


The :xfile:`requirements.txt` of :ref:`openui5` was lacking :ref:`tera` (which is needed by the lydiaUi5 demo project).
I reviewed the :xfile:`.travis.yml` file for :ref:`openui5`.
It seems that :ref:`travis` has now moved us from `.org` to `.com`.  I guess
that it not important for our work.

The `failure
<https://travis-ci.com/github/lino-framework/openui5/jobs/364957835>`__ with
:message:`Exception: No '__file__' in 'lino_openui5'. First parameter to must be
'globals()'` was because it was checking out the stable branch of atelier. But
we don't currently use branches, so this was getting a very old version of
atelier.


Optimizations for dealing with checkdata problems (continued)
=============================================================

I reviewed :ref:`book.specs.checkdata` and started to work on :ticket:`3727`.
