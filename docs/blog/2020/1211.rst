I watched Brad Traversy's `React JS Crash Course
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBws8MSXN7A>`__. Great work, Brad!

With Lino we don't have a static :file:`index.html` file because that's being
served by Django.

In :mod:`lino_react.react.views` I renamed :class:`App` to :class:`Index`.

I read `webpack Code Splitting <https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/>`,
but still have no clear idea about how to reduce the size of our
:xfile:`main.js` file.

I read the `React Context doc page <https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html>`__
but still have no clear idea about why I had to manually remove application data
after the last Noi upgrade.
