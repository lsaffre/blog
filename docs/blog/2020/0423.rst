Registrable and toggle_state
============================

Oops, :ticket:`3602` was more complex. No no,  the :class:`Registrable
<lino.mixins.registrable.Registrable>` mixin worked also when there was no state
named "registered". We *do* want certain fields of a course to be read-only in
certain states.  We don't want let end users edit e.g. the teacher or the room
of an active course. To change these fields, you need to first switch back to
"draft".  This concept of "registrable fields" is the main feature of
Registrable.

Only the relatively new :meth:`toggle_state
<lino.mixins.registrable.Registrable.toggle_state>` action also required a state
named "registered".

I undid my yesterday changes (i.e. Reservation again inherits from Registrable)
and moved the :meth:`toggle_state
<lino.mixins.registrable.Registrable.toggle_state>` action to the
:class:`lino_xl.lib.ledger.RegistrableVoucher` mixin.   Also started to review
the docstrings.


A screen cast about :ref:`presto`
=================================

Yesterday I recorded a first screen cast about :ref:`presto` (in German) and
added a link to it in :ref:`presto.de.tour`.
