=========================

The :attr:`lino_xl.lib.cal.RecurrenceSet.positions` field was not visible
:ref:`amici`.  I now added it to the detail layout in :mod:`lino_xl.lib.courses`.

.. currentmodule:: lino_xl.lib.courses

.. I would have wanted to do the following changes, but then I saw that they cause
  changes in the demo data.
  - The fields :attr:`Course.every_unit` and :attr:`Course.every` now have the
    same default value as defined by :mod:`lino_xl.lib.cal`.
  - The :term:`activity line` or an :term:`activity` (:attr:`Course.line`) can now
    be null.


I added a :fixture:`std` fixture to :mod:`lino_amici.lib.amici`.  TODO: This
should actually be in :mod:`lino_xl.lib.courses`, but the existing demo fixtures
will need to

When you ask to generate meetings for an activity with positions, Lino said
:message:`AjaxExceptionResponse TypeError: can't compare datetime.datetime to
datetime.date`.




Checklist items per ticket
==========================

I saw that Tonis added a spontaneous idea: check list items per ticket.
Phabricator also has this notion.  I finished what he should have done: adapt
the doctests.  I also did some style changes, added a view for the Explorer
menu, made the labels translatable.
