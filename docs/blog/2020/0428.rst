Trying to fix :ticket:`3613` (book failing on travis with "error: package
directory 'lino_react/projects' does not exist").

I noticed that react had no :xfile:`test_packages.py`.  I added it.  My
suggestion to remove :mod:`lino_react.projects` from the packages in
:xfile:`setup.py` won't work then.  Until now all our repos adhere to the rule
that all packages are published in the PyPI as well.  Whether this rule is good
deserves meditation, but the easiest way and fix the problem seems to  to stick
to the rule for now and just remove the prune from the :xfile:`MANIFEST.in`. I
started new-style change logging for react (one page per year,
`react.changes.2020`).

Released lino-react 20.4.28 to PyPI and restarted a build of book on
:ref:`travis`. Now the test suite passes.

But the build then fails during :cmd:`inv bd`:

I also noted the following warnings that get issued during :cmd:`inv test`:

  func=xmlSecCheckVersionExt:file=xmlsec.c:line=188:obj=unknown:subj=unknown:error=19:invalid version:mode=abi compatible;
  expected minor version=2;
  real minor version=2;
  expected subminor version=25;
  real subminor version=26

I guess that they are unrelated and not important.
