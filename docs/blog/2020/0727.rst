Wow, this week end I went into the 18000 checkdata problem messages at weleup.
For historical reasons they have quite some differences between the partner
addresses and the individual address records.  That's why I started
:ticket:`3727`.  Our goal is to have Lino fix most of these data issues.  This
must be fool proof and well tested, because invalid data fixes would not turn
out until it's too late.

Added 150 lines of doctests in :ref:`specs.addresses.AddressOwnerChecker`.

For the first time I wrote :term:`manual testing` instructions targeted to core
developers.  I plan to collect them in a single document, :ref:`team.mt`.

The min9 demo now also has phones and sepa plugins. The idea of this demo is to
have "all" plugins installed for testing purposes.
