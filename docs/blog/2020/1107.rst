My old Dell notebook, used now by Ly, doesn't start any more after it froze
suddenly while Ly was working. Maybe it had gotten too hot.  Or some RAM or SSD
is getting old.

When starting it up, it only says "Invalid partition table!".  I created an
lubuntu startup USB stick in order to boot.

Strange: I created the lubuntu startup stick from an iso file I had downloaded
already in September 22.  20.04.1

The machine behaves perfectly when booted from the live lubuntu stick.

  $ sudo fdisk /dev/sda
  Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.34).
  Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
  Be careful before using the write command.
  Command (m for help): v
  Remaining 2734 unallocated 512-byte sectors.


I started `sudo gparted`.  I selected :menuselection:`Device --> Attempt Data
Rescue`:

- No file systems found on /dev/sda
- The disk scan by gpart did not find any recognizable file systems on this disk.

Again in gparted I did right click on the /dev/sda1 partition and select
"Check". Then "run pending operations".  This created the following report::

I tried Christophe Grenier's testdisk utility::

  $ sudo apt install testdisk

It said that there were problems but that it cannot fix them.


I copied the data to another machine.

Memtest86 (version 5.01) always froze at the same place, at 63% of Test #2.
Maybe it is just the problem described `here
<https://www.memtest86.com/tech_freezing-lockups.html>`__: If the freeze occurs
in MemTest86 but the system runs normally otherwise, the problem is likely with
the UEFI firmware. The most common issue is when running MemTest86 using
multiple CPU cores (default behaviour).



The lubuntu boot usb can only start lubuntu but has no option


I installed a new Ubuntu 20.10 on onto the first SSD (/dev/sda), overriding the
partitions, including a Windows 7 that had been kept from doll's previous owner
when we bought it many years ago.
