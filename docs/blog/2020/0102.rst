=========================

I found the next issue in the :mod:`lino_xl.lib.eevat` : Field [4] includes an
amount that has been booked by the *opening entry*, i.e. a miscellaneous journal
entry on 2018-01-01 that actually contains :term:`preliminary transactions`.
Lino did not yet have this concept. Now I introduced it. New field
:attr:`lino_xl.lib.ledger.Journal.preliminary`.  I also added a little set of
demo bookings.

Should the :class:`vat.MovementsByDeclaration` table have this hard-coded filter
condition `exclude=dict(vat_class='')`? Probably not.

En passant, in :mod:`lino_xl.lib.ledger`, I renamed  ChangeState to ToggleState
and change_state to toggle_state.
