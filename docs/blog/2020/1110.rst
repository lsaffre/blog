Demo pupils must not be responsible users of a course.

The :mod:`lino_voga.lib.courses` plugin (default courses implementation for
voga) didn't yet inspect `SiteConfig.pupil_guestrole`. Fixed. This bug became
visible only now because the plugin was not yet being used in any demo project
because roger has its custom extension :mod:`lino_voga.lib.roger.courses`.

Demo events in the future must not have state "Took place".
