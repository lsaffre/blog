=======================

min3 demo project needs the std fixture for contacts. Until now this didn't
cause any problem but now the demo fixture requires the std fixture.

The std fixture of the lists plugin accidentally imported the std fixture of the
contacts plugin, causing e.g. a duplicate list of company types and contact
functions.  Funny that nobody ever noticed it during all this time...

En passant I changed the verbose name of :class:`lino_xl.lib.contacts.Role` from
"Contact Person" to "Contact person". Perfectionist without too strict deadline.
