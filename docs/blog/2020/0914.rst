I updated the Rumma & Ko website and the community guide to the new situation:
instead of calling ourselves a "team of three full-time developers" we are now a
"family-sized team with a network of independent certified developers".  We no
longer provide long-term jobs but rather temporary financial support for people
who seriously invest time to learn how they can make their own money using Lino.
