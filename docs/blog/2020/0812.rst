==========================

The insert window in Office --> Uploads had the fields type and file on the same
row, which doesn't render well in ExtJS (the type combo doesn't open).

The UploadsByController in presto now has a custom insert_layout which adds the
company field.

The insert_layout defined on uploads.UploadsByProject was the same as the one
defined on its parent uploads.UploadsByController. Removed duplicate code. This
saves one duplicate object in the generated JS.

Oops, the test i added yesterday for covering :ticket:`3745` caused side effects
in the test suite because it created a client.  And in min9 the problem was not
actually reproduced because min9 had no site_company (and therefore a new person
didn't have any address field, so Lino didn't even try to create an Address).
The test is now being done in  `min9.tests.test_addresses`.


Luc getting started with React
==============================


I worked on :ticket:`3709` (Luc getting started with React).
Merged a pull request introduced by a user g4ndy.

My goal is to have a comprehensible documentation in :ref:`react.guide`.
