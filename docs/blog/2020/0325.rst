I continued on :ticket:`3477`.  Started to review the :term:`end-user
documentation` (:ref:`presto.de.tour`) in dedocs/basics/tour.rst

Removed Journals "Sales credit notes" and "Purchase invoices" from presto demo
data.  They simply aren't generated when
:attr:`lino_xl.lib.vat.Plugin.declaration_plugin` is None.

All orders of the demo project had state "Done" (registered). Not realistic.

There were no transitions in the workflow buttons of orders.
