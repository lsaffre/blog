Uff, I finished :ticket:`3817`.

It seems that en passant this also fixed :ticket:`1985`. The use case is as
follows. In :ref:`welfare` we have cascaded clearing. Cascaded clearing is used
when we have more than one steps to be cleared. In welfare every purchase
invoice goes through the following payment steps::

  4100 Suppliers
  4450 Disbursing orders to execute
  4300 Pending payment orders

I can manually create a REG, then suggest an AAW. The supplier is
correctly cleared. But when I then let Lino suggest a ZKBC (based on the AAW),
Lino books the counter booking again to 4100 (suppliers) instead of 4450
(disbursing orders to execute), so that 4100 has now three movements and is
again uncleared.

This was because :meth:`FinancialVoucher.due2itemdict` was doing this::

    def due2itemdict(self, due, **kwargs):
        kwargs.update(match=due.match, account=due.account)
        if due.trade_type:  # 20201014
            ma = due.trade_type.get_main_account()
            if ma:
                kwargs.update(account=ma)

That is, it *always* puts the main account of the trade type (when a trade type
is known).  The trade_type of a DueMovement is the first suggestable trade type
found, i.e. the one of the first invoice.
