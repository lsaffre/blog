Adding task management to Presto
================================

:class:`lino_xl.lib.cal.TasksByController` now has :attr:`display_mode
<lino.core.actors.Actor.display_mode>` set to 'summary' by default. Only in
:ref:`welfare` we manually set it back to 'grid' to remain conservative. This
little change made me discover the following bug.

About the URIs of a JS renderer
===============================

Today I worked mostly on :ticket:`3545`.  It seems that this was a bug that
existed already some time (I guess :blogref:`20190719`) without having been
noticed: the action links in a table summary panel used permalink URIs although
they should use javascript URIs. At least in a default summary panel, i.e.
without a custom :meth:`lino.core.actors.Actor.get_summary_table` method.

I wrote first docs about
:attr:`lino.core.requests.BaseRequest.is_on_main_actor`.

I added a new attribute :attr:`lino.core.requests.BaseRequest.permalink_uris`.

The following doctests cover this subtle and complex topic:

- :ref:`noi.specs.memo`
- :ref:`noi.specs.std`
- :ref:`lino.specs.html`
- :ref:`welfare.specs.memo`
