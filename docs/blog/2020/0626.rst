I worked on :ticket:`3633`. Lino has a new admin command :manage:`passwd`.
And I reviewed the :ref:`dev.users` page.

I like the `click <https://pypi.org/project/click/>`__ package, which we
use extensively for :ref:`getlino`. I wanted to use this package also for the
:manage:`passwd` command. But ouch! Django admin commands have special
requirements! No problem:  I discovered `django-click
<https://pypi.org/project/django-click/>`__, which is exactly what I needed now.

Yes, Lino now requires both click and clint, which is a bit redundant. TODO:
convert :manage:`checkdata` to also use django-click instead of clint.
