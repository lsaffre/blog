The UploadsByClient table had this method::

   @classmethod
   def format_row_in_slave_summary(self, ar, obj):
       if obj.end_date and obj.end_date < settings.SITE.today():
           return None
       return super(UploadsByClient, self).format_row_in_slave_summary(
           ar, obj)

This method has caused a few hours of worries to Johanna because she believed
that Lino was automatically deleting all uploads when their validity date had
expired.

I now removed the method. I guess that this filtering was some old idea that
nobody actually ever wanted.

I renamed ``UploadsByClient`` to ``UploadsByProject``.  The :attr:`master` is no
longer `dd.plugins.clients.client_model` but `lino.core.site.Site.project_model`
(which is the same for all existing applications that use uploads).

The uploads plugin in :ref:`presto` was not yet visible. After a feedback from
Margarete I guess that they also want this plugin, and not just the plain modlib
variant but the xl variant (with expiry date management)

Presto adds another upload shortcut "Category certificate".

Changed a few rules in the demo fixtures:

The :fixture:`std` fixture of the :mod:`lino.modlib.uploads` plugin now
automatically creates one upload type for each shortcut, and no longer requires
the id_document shortcut.
