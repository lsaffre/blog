I am preparing a first screencast for :ref:`presto`.

Oops, found a bug in the calendar workflow: cannot set the calendar entry to
"planned" because 1 worker is "planned".  Opened :ticket:`3599`.

The default guest state in Presto was "invited".
I changed it to "present" because the internal guest state name "invited" is
what triggers the message in the voga workflow.

Note that we do not want Lino to change the guest_state automatically to
"present" (by setting :attr:`force_guest_states` to True).  Because when a
worker has been replaced by another worker, we want to see them both in the
database for this deployment.

But how to change the default value of a choicelist field? The following tricks
didn't work::

  dd.update_field(Guest, 'state', default='present')
  dd.update_field(Guest, 'state', default=GuestStates.present.as_callable())

The former doesn't work because specifying the default value of a choicelist
field as a string works only when the field is created, not when updating it.
And there is no on-update hook yet (and that would be overkill). The latter
doesn't work because the guest states are filled only after having imported the
models.  We might put that line in the :attr:`Site.custom_workflows_module`.

Another idea was to add a new plugin setting
:attr:`default_guest_state <lino_xl.lib.cal.Plugin.default_guest_state>`.
