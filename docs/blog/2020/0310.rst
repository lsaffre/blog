New model :class:`lino_presto.lib.contacts.Member` represents a worker's team membership.
Added more demo workers, and create demo team memberships for them all.
New method :meth:`orders.Order.get_worker_choices` which, in Presto, returns only the workers of the team (defined by the journal).
New model mixin :class:`DateRangeObservable`.

The :attr:`has_open_movements
<lino_xl.lib.contacts.PartnerEvents.has_open_movements>`  choice to the
:attr:`observed_events <lino_xl.lib.contacts.Partners.observed_events>`
parameter field of the :class:`lino_xl.lib.contacts.Partners` table didn't work
and was not tested. Fixed it and added test coverage in :ref:`xl.specs.accounting`.
