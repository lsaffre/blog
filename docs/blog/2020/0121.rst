I fixed :ticket:`3480`, another bug that appeared during yesterday's screen
cast.  The partner "Maksu- ja Tolliamet" was indeed simply created twice by two
different fixtures.

And the VAT declarations were not getting paid because the match rule for the
:term:`common account` :attr:`tax_offices` was missing (in the
:fixture:`minimal_ledger` fixture of :mod:`lino_xl.lib.ledger`).

And the demo companies had unrealistic VAT regimes. sepa must come before VAT
because the VAT demo sets the VAT regimes of demo companies added by sepa.
