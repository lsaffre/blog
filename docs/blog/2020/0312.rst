I continued with :ticket:`3477` and finally started to see progress.  This
project is a good challenge for Lino.  Also for myself it has one new aspect:
instead of doing analysis incrementally together with their contact person, they
produced a 20 pages document describing "what they want".  Which is of course an
illusion, but it has some advantages and might be more efficient in their
situation (which is that they don't have any employee who seems competent for
doing the analysis).
