I tried a system upgrade, but it failed::

  Could not calculate the upgrade

  An unresolvable problem occurred while calculating the upgrade.

  This was likely caused by:
  * Unofficial software packages not provided by Ubuntu
  Please use the tool 'ppa-purge' from the ppa-purge
  package to remove software from a Launchpad PPA and
  try the upgrade again.

  If none of this applies, then please report this bug using the command
  'ubuntu-bug ubuntu-release-upgrader-core' in a terminal. If you want to
  investigate this yourself the log files in '/var/log/dist-upgrade' will contain
  details about the upgrade. Specifically, look at 'main.log' and 'apt.log'.

  Restoring original system state.

Indeed I have some additional ppa files in my :file:`/etc/apt/sources.list.d`::
