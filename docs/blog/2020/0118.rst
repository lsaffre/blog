:ref:`cosi` is alomost ready for a demo to Taavi. I was already recording a
screen cast. But during the session I discovered :ticket:`3470` and started
working on it...

The :class:`lino_xl.lib.ledger.ExpectedMovements` table and its subclasses are
virtual tables, and each row is a volatile :class:`DueMovement <lino_xl.lib.ledger.DueMovement>`
instance. That's why its :meth:`get_row_by_pk
<lino.core.actors.Actor.get_row_by_pk>` is rather tricky.
It needs to know the voucher because the D/C of a DueMovement depends on the "target".

The request itself was perfect::

  in request POST /api/finan/SuggestionsByBankStatement (data: <QueryDict: {
    'pv': ['', '12.06.2019', '', '6', '', '', '', ''],
    'lv': ['1579407249.1660907'],
    'mk': ['263'], 'mt': ['42'],
    'query': ['brec'], 'an': ['do_fill'],
    'sr': ['921']}>)

The problem was a bug in the :mod:`lino.core.requests`:  The
:meth:`set_selected_pks` method (which calls :meth:`get_row_by_pk
<lino.core.actors.Actor.get_row_by_pk>`) is called when the
:attr:`master_instance` has been set.


Another bug was that :class:`lino.core.actions.DeleteSelected` did not set
`refresh_all` to True.  That's a bit strange, it even explicitly said True.  I
can't imagine why we were saying this.
