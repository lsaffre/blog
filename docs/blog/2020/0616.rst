I continued to work on :ticket:`3683` (Cannot query "Eleonora ...": Must
be "Client" instance.)

Remember what we had in :doc:`0610`:

>>> import lino
>>> lino.startup('lino_book.projects.avanti1.settings')
>>> from lino.api.doctest import *
>>> u = rt.login('robin').get_user()
>>> qs = rt.models.uploads.Upload.objects.all()
>>> qs = qs.filter(project__coachings_by_client__user=u)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: Cannot query "Robin Rood": Must be "Client" instance.

In our doctest the problem  does *not* disappear after the first request:

>>> qs = rt.models.uploads.Upload.objects.all()
>>> qs = qs.filter(project__coachings_by_client__user=u)

Which means that something else makes it disappear... mysterious!

The root of the problem is that `uploads.Uploads` has a filter parameter
:attr:`coached_by` which makes sense only when the :mod:`lino_xl.lib.coachings`
is installed.  Django seems to not behave 100% consistently when you ask to
filter using an invalid lookup, but that's not a big issue.

In :ref:`welfare` we want a filter parameter :attr:`coached_by` for upload
files. This is different from the upload's author.  Social agents want to see
expiring upload files for the clients they are coaching even when the uploader
was a colleague.

This functionality might make sense in Avanti where they have no coaching
history.
