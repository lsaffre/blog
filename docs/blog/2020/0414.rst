I worked on :ticket:`3589`.

The :xfile:`orders/Order/base.weasy.html` template (in
:mod:`lino_xl.lib.orders`) no longer prints some fields in an intro block. This
was never useful and rather disturbing.

In :mod:`lino_presto.lib.contacts` I renamed the :class:`Member` model to
:class:`Membership`.

The :meth:`get_calview_chunks` method is no longer used, we use
:meth:`get_event_summary` instead.

We currently have a print_actions field in the Worker detail, which prints a
weekly "roster" per worker using the  :xfile:`contacts/Person/roster.weasy.html`
template. That's basically what we want, but it's impolite to ask the secretary
to enter the start and end dates for each worker, and actually to ask them at
all. That action should move to the worker calendar view where Lino knows the
week.

I moved the virtual field :attr:`name_column` from contacts.Partner to
:attr:`core.model.Model`.  It does almost the same as the existing
:attr:`mobile_item` field.  Not yet sure

In Presto I now override the name_column field in the WorkersParameters actor.

TODO: Customize WorkersParameters.name_column so that it adds a print button.


I had a successful data migration with Hamza and reviewed the docs about
:ref:`hosting.move`,
:ref:`admin.upgrade` and
:ref:`lino.datamig`.
