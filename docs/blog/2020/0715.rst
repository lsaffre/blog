Fixed several little problems when building the book docs (:cmd:`inv clean -b bd`).

**WARNING: [autosummary] failed to import 'lino_avanti.lib.avanti.user_types': no module named lino_avanti.lib.avanti.user_types**

How to reproduce it::

  $ python -c "import lino; lino.startup('lino_book.projects.max.settings.doctests'); import lino_avanti.lib.avanti.user_types"

Explanation: The :mod:`lino_xl.lib.uploads` plugin didn't work when
:attr:`lino_xl.lib.clients.Plugin.client_model` was not a subclass of ClientBase. Because the `coached_by`
parameter field wasn't created at all. Now it gets created as a dummy field.

Also the memo parser refused to have a second renderer for a same model.  But
that's a legitimate thing happening when
:attr:`lino_xl.lib.clients.Plugin.client_model` was as its default value
`'contacts.Person'`: we then have two memo commands ``person`` and ``client``
both pointing to the same model.  Which is actually no problem. It just means
that the inverse mechanism (rendering a given database object as a memo command)
will yield one of them.


**ResourceWarning: unclosed file <_io.BufferedReader name='/home/luc/work/lino/lino/modlib/languages/fixtures/iso-639-3_20100707.tab'>**

--> Fixed some more causes for ResourceWarning, but then removed the line (in
:file:`lino/__init__.py`) that turns the warning into an error.

**intersphinx inventory has moved: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/objects.inv -> https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/objects.inv**

--> Changed http to https
