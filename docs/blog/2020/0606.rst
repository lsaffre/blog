Johanna suggested that Lino should also read nationality of a Belgian EID card
holder. The problem with this is that this data is not very normalized. Lino
uses a field :attr:`nationality` which is a pointer to
:class:`lino_xl.lib.places.Country`. For a French citizen the value on the eid
card can be "Français", "Française", "Frans", "Franzose", "Französin", "French"
depending on the sex and the issuing municipality.

As a compromise I added a new database field
:attr:`lino_xl.lib.beid.BeIdHolder.nationality_text`. (:ticket:`3681`)
