The :meth:`request_handler` method
==================================

The :meth:`request_handler` method of an action request builds and returns the
Javascript code that would execute this request on the client.

It obviously depends on the front-end renderer. The publisher renderer returns
`None`.

It is needed by `WrappedAction`, `ShowSlaveTable`,  `RequestFieldElement`,
`Renderer.href_to_request()`. It is also needed by ShowSuggestions or
ShowEntriesByDay, which are similar to ShowSlaveTable


It is needed by WrappedAction to build the URI for an action at runtime::

  class WrappedAction(Action):
    ...
    def run_from_ui(self, ar, **kw):
        sar = self.bound_action.request_from(ar)
        js = ar.renderer.request_handler(sar)
        ar.set_response(eval_js=js)

WrappedAction is a kind of dynamic URL, it does nothing but return a Javascript
snippet to be executed on the client.

The :class:`WrappedAction` class is used:

- by :class:`QuickLinksList` (the class of the
  object sitting on :attr:`settings.SITE.quicklinks`)

- by custom implementations of :meth:`collect_extra_actions`, e.g. the "Pretty
  view" action on a blog entry, the "Import from VCard" action on a partner, or
  the actions used by the calendar view to switch between daily, weekly and
  monthly view.
