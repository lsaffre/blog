Miscellaneous
=============

The Welfare test suite needed some care after the changes of last
weeks. I created a sticky ticket :ticket:`881` for this kind of work.


I changed the `insert_layout` of `tickets.ui.Tickets`.

The `detail_layout` of a ticket is now overridden in
:mod:`lino_noi.projects.team.lib.tickets.models` (and no longer in
:mod:`lino_noi.lib.faculties`).  This is another example of why
:meth:`set_detail_layout <lino.core.actors.Actor.set_detail_layout>`
should maybe become deprecated (:ticket:`526`).

It seems that the general rule is: if you want your own detail_layout,
then you should write your own plugin.
