I merged Hamza's work on :ticket:`889`.

I also formulated and did :ticket:`896`:
:attr:`lino.core.site.Site.default_ui` is now the full Python name,
not just the app_label.

Now :mod:`lino_extjs6.projects.mysite` no longer needs to write a
modified copy of :meth:`get_installed_apps
<lino.core.site.Site.get_installed_apps>`.

This has the advantage that anybody can now test their own Lino
application by simply installing a snapshot of :mod:`lino_extjs6` and
adding the following in their local `Site` class definition::

  default_ui = 'lino_extjs6.extjs`
