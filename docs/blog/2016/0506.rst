ExtJS 6 support evolving
========================

I merged Hamza's work on :ticket:`889`.

And then I also did a commit to :mod:`lino_extjs6`: I formulated and
did :ticket:`896`: :attr:`lino.core.site.Site.default_ui` is now the
full Python name, not just the app_label.

Now :mod:`lino_extjs6.projects.mysite` no longer needs to write a
modified copy of :meth:`get_installed_plugins
<lino.core.site.Site.get_installed_plugins>`.

This has the advantage that anybody can now test their own Lino
application by simply installing a snapshot of :mod:`lino_extjs6` and
adding the following in their local `Site` class definition::

  default_ui = 'lino_extjs6.extjs`


Lino Voga
=========

A little change request from Alexa:
We revised the default column order of the :class:`ActivitiesByTopic
<lino_voga.lib.courses.models.ActivitiesByTopic>` table.
