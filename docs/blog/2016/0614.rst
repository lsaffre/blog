Last checkin with only documentation changes before I am leaving for
two nights to Nuutsaku.


More optimizations for Lino Voga
================================

After several Skype meetings with Alexa and Roger himself, here are
some (hopefully last) optimizations in the end sprint of
:ticket:`701`.

- New field :attr:`free_events
  <lino_voga.lib.courses.models.Enrolment.free_events>` of an
  enrolment.

- When :attr:`auto_type` of an event was changed, the summary is now
  automatically adapted.
