The :class:`JobsOverview
<lino_welfare.modlib.jobs.models.JobsOverview>` report was failing
after yesterday's internal optimizations.  It took me yet another hour
to repair it. But the result is cool: we no longer need the
:file:`JobsOverview/Default.odt` template, and the content of this
report is now being tested in :ref:`welfare.specs.jobs`.
