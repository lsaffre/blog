I pulled Hamza's work on :ticket:`357` into the master of
:mod:`atelier`.


The ``[url]`` memo command in a comment did not yet support the case
of specifying just an URL without text.  (:ticket:`720`).  Fixed the
bug and added a test case to :ref:`noi.specs.memo`.



Oh, I was surprised to read this:
`Microsoftâ€™s speedy Chakra JavaScript engine is now open source
<http://thenextweb.com/dd/2016/01/13/microsofts-speedy-chakra-javascript-engine-is-now-open-source/>`_.

And indeed, there is a `ChakraCore
<https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore>`_ project on GitHub.
