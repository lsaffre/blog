Resetting an event
==================

I changed a few things about the "Reset" action on a calendar event
(in :ref:`voga`):

- It now asks for a confirmation

- It is no longer defined as a transition on
  :attr:`EntryStates.suggested` but as a "real" action. 

- It is now available only on automatic events.


I tend to consider the concept of "workflow actions" as
deprecated. This idea came from Plone and was based on the assumption
that you can represent "workflow" using a single database field
representing a well define "state". But reality turns out to be more
complex.

- New site attribute :attr:`lino.core.site.Site.workflows_module`.
- Lino no longer executes any `setup_workflows` callable.
