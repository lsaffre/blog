====================================

Today I will (`inchalla <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inshallah>`_)
meet :ref:`hamza` for the first time in my life. I am now in Tallinn
airport and have one hour of time.

There is a new Lino fan in India: :ref:`subha`.  Thanks to his first
problem report I fixed some documentation bugs in
:ref:`lino.dev.install` and :ref:`dev.runtests`.
