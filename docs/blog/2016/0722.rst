=====================

Concerning :ticket:`1070`, there is at least one visible problem remaining:

    Dans le dialogue pour créer un nouvel atelier, Lino demande la "série
    de cours". Dans ce champ il affiche toutes les séries d'ateliers, pas
    seulement celles du domaine en question.  Si on crée son atelier en
    choisissant une série d'un autre domaine, alors l'atelier sera créé,
    mais ne sera visible dans la liste actuelle.

In order to solve this, I think that we need to fix :ticket:`232`.
This ticket is probably not *very* difficult, but this functionality
is not very well covered.  So I started to write new content in
:ref:`welfare.specs.chatelet`, :ref:`welfare.specs.eupen` and
:ref:`welfare.tested.reception`.  Which caused some new features in
:mod:`lino.api.doctest`.

New work for Hamza
==================

In a two hours hangout with Hamza we continued a bit on the ExtJS6
project before we decided that I will take these tickets and dive into
ExtJS6 during the next weeks. I realized this when Hamza showed me the
`Ext.grid.plugin.RowEditor` plugin. This is a cool new feature, but it
will probably require changes in the AJAX protocol. And this part of
Lino is very complex and very poorly documented.

And Hamza gets a new project: increase test coverage and write new
test cases. We started together by moving almost all remaining test
cases from :ref:`lino` to :ref:`book`. This was necessary because it
is :ref:`book` where we are going to add new "demo projects" in order
to increase coverage.
