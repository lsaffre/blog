=======================

I finished working on a small series of very specific tickets for
Mathieu and Aurélie:

- :ticket:`963` (Orientation interne: rajouter l'état "Demandé"):

  In :mod:`lino_welfare.projects.chatelet.modlib.courses`, I added a
  transition for going from :class:`EnrolmentStates
  <lino_xl.lib.courses.choicelists.EnrolmentStates>`
  "requested" to "confirmed".

  In Lino Welfare we do not want to automatically confirm enrolments,
  so I deactivated the
  :class:`lino_xl.lib.courses.models.ConfirmedSubmitInsert` which is
  set by :mod:`lino_xl.lib.courses`.  As a result, the default state
  is always "requested".

- :ticket:`904` : 
  In :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.integ` we now have a new plugin setting
  :attr:`only_primary <lino_welfare.modlib.integ.Plugin.only_primary>`
  which influences the dynamic ventilation columns coachings per
  PersonGroup)

  As a suggestion, the :class:`UsersWithClients
  <lino_welfare.modlib.integ.models.UsersWithClients>` table is now
  included in :class:`ActivityReport
  <lino_welfare.modlib.integ.models.ActivityReport>`.


I deployed the latest version to :ref:`welcht`

I opened ticket :ticket:`967`.



Duplicating a Referrable
========================

Strange. I noticed that a change which I believe to have done on
:doc:`0523` is no longer there and seems to never have been
committed. It seems that I only updated the docstring of
:meth:`lino.core.model.Model.on_duplicate`, but not the code. I am
getting old ;-)
