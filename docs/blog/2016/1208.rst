==========================

A ticket is no longer assignable
(:class:`lino.modlib.users.mixins.Assignable`), the `assigned_to`
field and the two actions defined there can go away.  And we get a new
pair of actions, defined on
:class:`lino_xl.lib.votes.mixins.Votable`:

- ☆ (an empty star) is visible only when this user does not yet have a
  vote on this object. Clicking it will create a default vote object
  and show that object in a detail window.
- ★ (a filled star) is visible only when this user does already have a
  vote on this object. Clicking it will show that existing object in a
  detail window.

This behaviour reminds that of :mod:`lino_xl.lib.stars`. There is
always at most one vote object per user and ticket.

New feature : it is now possible to say::

    class Votes(dd.Table):
        model = 'votes.Vote'
        ...

        @classmethod
        def do_setup(self):
            self.detail_action.hide_top_toolbar = True

This is different from saying::

    class Votes(dd.Table):
        model = 'votes.Vote'
        hide_top_toolbar = True

We want it for Votes because the *grid* view should have a normal top
toolbar, but the *detail window* whould be minimal (in order to make
its usage intuitive).
