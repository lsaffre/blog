========================

I am diving back into work after a forced break of more than a week.

I updated several sections in :ref:`lino.about`, as an answer to
:ref:`tanel`\ 's questions and as a preparation for my planned meeting
with :ref:`abakus`.

I fixed :ticket:`1254` because it was causing failures in several test
suites. Some test suites were failing just because notify installs
channels, so these applications have one additional plugin.

For :ref:`presto` and :ref:`welfare` we had
``'cairocffi<0.7'`` in :ref:`in install_requires`.
This was now disturbing on my machine for some reason.
