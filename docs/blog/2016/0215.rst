===================================

I did some changes to https://github.com/lsaffre/dblog after feedback
from James who is starting to get his developer blog up and running
(and published).

I continued to work on :ticket:`701`.  A room, in Lino Voga, no longer
overrides ``__unicode__`` to add the city name. This was just a stupid
idea of mine and irritating magic.

Repaired several tests which were failing with UnicodeErrors caused by
Hamza's `recent changes
<https://github.com/lsaffre/atelier/commit/5e108861bffaafb09efb54cdee469dcc13f685f2>`__
in :mod:`atelier`.
Most notably the :mod:`atelier.test.TestCase.test_simple_doctests` method now must use
:mod:`atelier.doctest_utf8` again.
