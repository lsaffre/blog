Activity report in Lino Noi
===========================

I started to work on :ticket:`993`.

I made a first attempt using a new DirectPrintAction
`PrintActivityReport`, but abandoned when I discovered that Lino does
not yet manage list actions with a parameter window.

I decided to convert ServiceReport from appypod to weasyprint.

I noted that calling :meth:`ar.show
<lino.core.requests.BaseRequest.show>` from within a template was
being rendered to the console by :class:`WeasyBuildMethod
<lino.modlib.weasyprint.choicelists.WeasyBuildMethod>`.

And then another "detail" :meth:`ar.show
<lino.core.requests.BaseRequest.show>` in a weasy document should not
add a grey background to the table cells. This is nice when rendering
tables e.g. in a slave table summary.  These `tableattrs` and
`cellattrs` now are no longer on the request but on the renderer.


The :class:`ProjectsByReport
<lino_noi.projects.team.lib.clocking.ui.ProjectsByReport>` table now
has a new column "Total time". See :ref:`noi.specs.clocking`.





Enrolment options
=================

Alexa started to configure Hikes for :ref:`eiche`. It is the first
time they use enrolment options.


A little optimization: the :meth:`__str__` method of `courses.Line` now
includes the :attr:`name` field.

The virtual fields
confirmed and requested of a course
now display the sum of places (and no longer the number of records).
