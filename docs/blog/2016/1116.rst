I integrated more feedback from :ref:`rauno` into the :ref:`lino.dev`.

Ticket :ticket:`1262` is still causing trouble. Rauno stumbled over
it, Travis stumbles over it... now it seems that I finally got it: The
real problem is that `bleach
<https://github.com/mozilla/bleach/blob/master/setup.py>`__ requires
version <0.99999999 of html5lib while `weasyprint
<https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/blob/master/setup.py>`__ requires
version >=0.999999999 of that same library. So you cannot currently
use both bleach and weasyprint. The good solution for this is to
update bleach so that it works with the newes version of html5lib.

Workaround for now: remove all version requirements, and make
:mod:`lino.mixins.bleached` again less strict: don't raise an
exception, just log a warning when bleach is not installed. This is as
it was until last week. The problem with this workaround is that it
might be a time bomb because bleach is currently inactive and might
become active at some unexpected moment in the future.
