I continued to work on the demo fixtures for :ref:`voga` in order to
have meaningful tests in the specs. The test suite is still failing.

The items of an invoicing plan now have a :attr:`preview
<lino_cosi.lib.invoicing.models.Item.preview>` field.

Hamza, I discovered and fixed a bug in the `calculatePageSize`
function introduced yesterday. Please adapt `my changes
<https://github.com/lsaffre/lino/commit/99232e8effd9ebbec17a27b448431a6b3d9314d7>`_
also to :mod:`lino_extjs6`.

The :class:`lino_cosi.lib.courses.models.Line` model did not yet
inherit from :class:`lino.mixins.Referrable` and therefore caused an
IntegrityError when trying to duplicate a record with a non-empty ref
field.
