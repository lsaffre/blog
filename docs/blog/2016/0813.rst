=========================

I committed my work of the last days: only documentation changes. I am
trying to get the :ref:`lino.admin` into a "good enough" state because
I hope that we will soon find companies in the EU who want to become
more active as Lino :ref:`hosting_provider`. I am still not satisfied
with the Administrator's Guide, but it getting better each time.

I also worked on the "Working with others" section of the
:ref:`lino.dev` because our newbies :ref:`grigorij` and :ref:`james`
are now ready for these chapters.
