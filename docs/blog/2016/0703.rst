MobiliseSME
===========

The EU is thinking about a program for sustaining mobility of
employees of small and medium enterprises (SME).  The program is
called `MobiliseSME
<http://mobilisesme.eu/index.php/en/aboutmobilisesme/>`__.  It is not
yet a program, it is only a *project* of a program, they are currently
analyzing whether it makes sense. In Estonia this is done by
:ref:`evea` who are running a `poll among Estonian SMEs
<http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/2752814/3965ace6b18d-Estonian>`_.

:ref:`rumma` (and thus Lino) might participate in this program in both
directions:

- I would work myself for one or two weeks as consultant for some SME
  somewhere in the EU in order to analyze their needs in order to get
  a Lino application up and running.

- receive system administrators or inhouse developers from other
  countries and give them Lino training which should enable them to
  instal or write a Lino application for their employer.

Such exchanges might last from one to several weeks.

Even if the EU would decide *not* to start this program, the idea
itself is great for Lino because the suboptimal documentation is
currently the missing jigsaw piece.

I introduced an application for becoming member of :ref:`evea`.
