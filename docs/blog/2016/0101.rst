I merged `PR16 <https://gitlab.com/lino-framework/lino_extjs6/pull/16>`_ with
Hamza's work on :ticket:`37` into :mod:`lino_extjs6`.

I worked on :ticket:`643`, trying to document the general process in a
separate document :ref:`team.deploy`.  The following are the specific
notes for this time.

About comparing the :xfile:`settings.py` files:

- The following option must be added::

          'OPTIONS': {
             "init_command": "SET storage_engine=MyISAM",
          }

  And then I had to move the following from test to prod::

    configure_plugin('b2c',
      delete_imported_xml_files=True,
      import_statements_path="/mnt/oeshz_home_server/ANWPROG/Lino/sepa_incoming")


- Switch the project directories to their new environments.
  For historical reasons the environment names in this case are
  `testlino`, `a`, `b`.

  Before::

        prod/env -> /home/luc/pythonenvs/testlino
        testlino/env -> /home/luc/pythonenvs/a

  After::

        prod/env -> /home/luc/pythonenvs/a
        testlino/env -> /home/luc/pythonenvs/b


- Restore production data from snapshot (nothing special). 

- Tests:

  - Lounch :menuselection:`Accounting --> Import SEPA statements`. Seems okay:

        4615 XML files with 1410 new and 4800 updated statements have
        been imported.


- Moved :file:`import_sepa.py` and :file:`import_sepa.sh` from testing
  to prod. Adapted the cron job.
