I merged the documentation trees for :ref:`lino` and :ref:`xl` into
one single tree. This tree is in a separate code repository
:mod:`lino_book`, and all "didactical" projects are now in this
repository as well.

Main reasons for this change are

- It is difficult to explain Lino without referring to :mod:`lino_xl`

- The "didactical projects" are not needed for people who just want to
  install and run some Lino application.
