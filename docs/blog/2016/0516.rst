====================

I merged the documentation trees for :ref:`lino` and :ref:`xl` into
one single tree. This tree is in a separate code repository
:mod:`lino_book`, and all "didactical" projects are now in this
repository as well.

Main reasons for this change are

- It is difficult to explain Lino without referring to :mod:`lino_xl`,
  so we need a "combined" documentation tree.

- The "didactical projects" (e.g. :mod:`lino_book.projects.min1`) are
  no longer included with the code repository, which is preferrable
  for people who just want to install and run some Lino application.

As a consequence, many unit tests moved to :mod:`lino_book`:
all those that are either based on doctest or
use some of the didactical projects.
