====================================

There was a documentation bug in :ref:`dev.install` which I discovered
thanks to :ref:`leena`: the guide instructed you to install *three*
packages using :cmd:`pip install -e` : lino, xl and book. But
:ref:`cosi` was missing there! It is required by book, and if it was
not installed from a clone before installing book, pip will install it
from PyPI, and that's a rather old version.

I updated the page, and I also added a new section `Troubleshooting
<http://lino-framework.org/dev/install.html#troubleshooting>`_
