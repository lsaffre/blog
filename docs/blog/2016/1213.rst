Now about the watchers of a ticket. Basically all those who have a
vote on a ticket are watchers and want to get notified when anything
happens.

It is currently a user preference whether notifications are sent by
email (1) immediately when they are emitted or only in a (2) daily
or (3) weekly summary.  Users cannot currently choose an individual
frequency per vote. We might add this feature one day when somebody
wants it, but currently we leave things simple.

Features to be verified:

- Writing a comment about a ticket should automatically add you to
  that ticket's list of watchers.

- A user can invite another user to watch a ticket: in the
  VotesByVotable table you simply insert a row for that user.

- Writing a comment about a ticket should send a comprehensive
  notification to all watchers which contains the full comment
  ("short" and "more" text).
