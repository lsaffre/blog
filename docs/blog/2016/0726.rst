================================

I fixed two trivial failures in the test suite of :ref:`book`.


Anzahlungsrechnungen
====================

Ticket :ticket:`1059`. Alexa and Roger agreed tht their original
implementation plan was overkill. We just need to adapt their print
template so that it includes information about advance payments.

In :ref:`voga`, the template used to print a sales invoice is
:xfile:`sales/VatProductInvoice/Default.odt`.  This file is in the
:xfile:`config` directory of :mod:`lino_xl.lib.trading`.  It is an
:term:`appy.pod` which uses itself two Jinja templates
:xfile:`sales/VatProductInvoice/body.html` and
:xfile:`sales/VatProductInvoice/trailer.html`.


Local system
admins might override it with a local version, but our goal is to
provide a robust template which is generally usable and easily
extendable using documented methods.


    do text
    from jinja('sales/VatProductInvoice/body')

    do text
    from jinja('sales/VatProductInvoice/trailer')



In :ref:`lino.admin.appy_templates`, the :func:`jinja
<lino_xl.lib.appypod.context.jinja>` no longer automatically adds
`.html` because that was a misfeature.

Zwei neue Teilnehmerfilter
==========================

Added two new filter parameters
:attr:`lino_voga.lib.courses.models.Pupils.course`
and
:attr:`lino_voga.lib.courses.models.Pupils.partner_list`.


Adressetiketten drucken
=======================

do text
from html(rec.address_html)
