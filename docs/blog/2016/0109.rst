=========================

I started a tutorial about :ref:`belref`.

Sandeep reported two problems which I noted as tickets.

The first is a disturbing warning: :ticket:`706`. I invited Sandeep to
fix it, that would be his first ticket fix.

I discovered and fixed a series of failures in the Welfare test suite
which caused by ticket :ticket:`698`.


The :envvar:`LINO_SITE_MODULE` environment variable
===================================================

The other problem was indirectly caused by :ticket:`707` (which I
fixed myself because it needs experience with setting up production
hosts ). The problem was::

    $ python manage.py runserver
    INFO Started manage.py runserver (using
    lino.projects.belref.settings.demo) --> PID 2327
    CommandError: You must set settings.ALLOWED_HOSTS if DEBUG is False.
    INFO Done manage.py runserver (PID 2327)

Sandeep reported correctly that setting :setting:`DEBUG` to `True` in
:file:`belref/settings/demo.py` was the fix.  The problem passed
*inaper√ßu* on my machine because I have a `djangosite_local`
module in my :envvar:`PYTHONPATH`.  Solution was to replace the
hard-coded name :xfile:`djangosite_local.py` by an environment
variable :envvar:`LINO_SITE_MODULE`.
