Lino Welfare
============

I did :ticket:`1096` and released in :ref:`welcht`.

I continued to adapt :ref:`welfare.specs.esf`.

The field :attr:`has_esf
<lino_welfare.modlib.pcsw.models.Client.has_esf>` was not yet visible
in the detail window.

I renamed :meth:`EventGenerator.update_cal_calender` to
:meth:`lino_xl.lib.cal.mixins.EventGenerator.update_cal_event_type`.
      
I wrote a new data checker :meth:`ObsoleteEventTypeChecker
<lino_xl.lib.cal.models.ObsoleteEventTypeChecker>` which will be used
when they modify their configuration. And it found some problems in
their data:

    201608-09 06:13:51 INFO models : Found 707 and fixed 0 data problems in Events.

(I will run :manage:`checkdata` with ``--fix`` manually after a visual
check with the customer.)

The message "User %s has no email address" (and one other) logged by
:meth:`Notification.send_email` is now being logged at the debug level
because we don't want to see it every 10 seconds.
