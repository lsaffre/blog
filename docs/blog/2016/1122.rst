==========================

I repaired the test suites after miscellaneous changes of the last
days. All failures were trivial, except one, in
:ref:`noi.specs.as_pdf`, for which is don't yet see the explanation::

  $ go noi
  $ python setup.py test -s tests.SpecsTests.test_as_pdf  
    (...)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/media/dell1tb/virtualenvs/py27/lib/python2.7/site-packages/appy/pod/converter.py", line 20, in <module>

        raise ImportError('This package should not be accessible on Python 3. '
    ImportError: This package should not be accessible on Python 3. Either you are trying to run from the python-future src folder or your installation of python-future is corrupted.

This looks as if the python3 executable (which is called by
:term:`appy.pod` for converting the document using UNO) gets a wrong
PYTHONPATH.  I could not reproduce the problem within a real browser.
I marked these tests as SKIP and wrote :ticket:`1282`.
