Alexa reported some new cases of item descriptions, i.e. optimizations
for the :xfile:`courses/Enrolment/item_description.html` template.  I
adapted the demo fixture
:mod:`lino_voga.projects.voga2.settings.fixtures.voga` and added
example in the tested specs :ref:`voga.specs.invoicing`.

TODO: The test suite has failures because the demo data has changed.

Release on :ref:`lf` and on :ref:`eiche`. I worked on several little
problems in parallel.

The last series of commits in :ref:`voga` were because I am still
fiddling with `whitespace control
<http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/#whitespace-control>` in
:xfile:`courses/Enrolment/item_description`.
