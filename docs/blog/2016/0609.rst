Miscellaneous
=============

I fixed two :ref:`ise` tracebacks which arrived from :ref:`eiche`::

  RelatedObjectDoesNotExist
  Enrolment has no pupil.
  in request POST /api/courses/EnrolmentsByCourse
  lino_voga/lib/courses/models.py in pupil_info
            txt = self.pupil.get_full_name(nominative=True)

  AttributeError 
  'BankStatementItem' object has no attribute 'match_changed'
  in request PUT /api/finan/ItemsByBankStatement/1554
  lino_cosi/lib/finan/mixins.py,  in guess_amount, line 286

Handling partial payments
=========================

Alexa and I discovered yet another series of optimizations for
:ref:`voga`. Mostly about handling partial payments.

New table :class:`lino_xl.lib.trading.models.DueInvoices`.  I started
to write content for :ref:`voga.specs.trading`.  

New virtual fields :attr:`balance_before
<lino_xl.lib.trading.models.VatProductInvoice.balance_before>` and
:attr:`balance_to_pay
<lino_xl.lib.trading.models.VatProductInvoice.balance_to_pay>`.

New parameter field :attr:`cleared
<lino_xl.lib.ledger.ui.PartnerVouchers.cleared>` for
:class:`lino_xl.lib.ledger.ui.PartnerVouchers`.

They want a new voucher state :attr:`cancelled
<lino_xl.lib.ledger.choicelists.VoucherStates.cancelled>`.

:mod:`lino_xl.lib.finan.fixtures.demo_bookings` now generates a more
realistic situation. Until now it was rather utopic: all customers
paid their invoices as suggested and in time.  where not all most
payments are arriving as suggested, i.e. the customer pays the full
ammount. But there are exceptions: 5% discount taken at payment,
partly payments, not paying at all, or (very accidentally) paying 2%
too much.
