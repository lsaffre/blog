=======================

One little surprise after the release. The following code caused a
:message:`TypeError: 'unicode' object is not callable`::

    @dd.displayfield(_('Printed'))
    def printed(self, obj, ar):
        return obj.printed(ar)


I added a section to :ref:`welfare.specs.aids` which reproduces the
problem, then fixed it. Also checked in and pulled to cpaseupen.

Note that this table :class:`ConfirmationsByGranting
<lino_welfare.modlib.aids.models.ConfirmationsByGranting>` is quite
hackerish and not very elegant. But I don't see any easier solution
for this situation. One day I should explain this to Hamza.
