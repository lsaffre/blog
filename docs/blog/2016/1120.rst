I worked on :ticket:`1227` and did a rather radical change in
:mod:`lino.modlib.notify` which I shortly mentioned in a comment to
:ticket:`923`:

     remove the Message.subject field. A notification message has just
     a body. This fixes our design problem of having redundant text in
     subject and body.

Testing these things is time-consuming because many situations are not
yet covered by automated tests.


Found and fixed a bug: The actions RefuseClient and MarkClientFormer
did not actually change the new client_state.

In :mod:`lino.modlib.notify.fixtures` renamed demo to demo2 because
not all users were being notified.

Message.body is now a RichTextField and

TextFieldElement.value2html now uses :meth:`E.raw` instead of
:meth:`E.fromstring` in order to display HTML content correctly also
in a html summary.

Added :meth:`Textfieldelement.format_value` in order to render HTML
content in a rst table.
