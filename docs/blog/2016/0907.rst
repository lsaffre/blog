Oops, Travis `build #33
<https://travis-ci.org/lino-framework/book/jobs/157973116>`__ of
:ref:`book` failed because I didn't even run the test suite before
checking in.


Tonight I watched `a video on YouTube
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzeN6WjYCu0>`__ which Hamza
recommened. It is made by an Italian couple.  I also watched YouTube's
`suggestion <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvhO8DUirmY>`__
thereafter and started to watch `La Tunisie est bel et bien est un
pays Ã  part du monde arabe . :)
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGAZNnJH96k>`__...


Tunisia is exciting, but yesterday I had a 90 minutes meeting with
:ref:`annalisa` which generated yet another series of ideas for
:ticket:`1128` which I should implement ASAP:

DONE:

- Should we add a new ticket state "dropped" or "withdrawn"
  ("Verworfen", "Widerrufen") to indicate that the *reporter* decided
  to cancel their plea? This is different from "refused".  -->
  Solution seems to rename "refused" to "cancelled" because this is a
  more general term.
        
- When opening text editor in own window, there are no TinyMCE buttons
  at all. That was because I forget to update
  :xfile:`tiny_mce_popup.js`.
  
- Cannot create new users using the web interface.
  
  :message:`AttributeError: 'SiteConfig' object has no attribute
  :'site_company'` in
  :class:`lino_xl.lib.countries.mixins.AddressLocation`.

  I fixed this by moving the definition of the :attr:`site_company
  <lino.modlib.system.models.SiteConfig.site_company>` field from
  :mod:`lino_xl.lib.contacts` (where it was defined using
  inject_field) to :mod:`lino.modlib.system.models`.  Note that I left
  the definition of `next_partner_id` field in
  :mod:`lino_xl.lib.contacts` because this field would be *really*
  nonsense for somebody who does not have the
  :mod:`lino_xl.lib.contacts` plugin installed.

- Adapt Ticket.rate wording
  
- When there are notifications, display them directly as welcome
  messages (including a checkbox for each of them to mark them as
  seen)
  
SIDE EFFECTS:

- I changed the general behaviour of :meth:`get_admin_main_items`
  slightly: when a table contains no items, Lino no longer displays
  the title and the "No data to display", it just skips that table.


- New symbol ðŸ—— for opening an admin_main_item in its own window.
  
- :meth:`ar.show <lino.core.requests.BaseRequest.show>` no longer
  spawns a new request when it receives a `BaseRequest` instance as
  first parameter. A usage for this new feature is in
  :xfile:`admin_main_base.html` where we create a request `sar`, call
  its :meth:`get_total_count` method (which triggers a first database
  request), and then (if there is data) we forward it to
  :meth:`ar.show <lino.core.requests.BaseRequest.show>`.  Without the
  new behaviour, Lino would do an additional SQL query for every item
  of the main page.  This change required me to adapt some tested
  documents (e.g.  :ref:`welfare.specs.debts`) which still were using
  the deprectated form.

- I fixed a bug in :xfile:`linoweb.js` which caused Lino to not
  automatically refresh the screen when toggling between â˜† and â˜….  The
  :attr:`refresh_all
  <lino.core.requests.ValidActionResponses.refresh_all>` by the action
  was being ignored when the action had been called from the main
  screen.

TODO:

- The window created by the `detail_layout` of
  :class:`lino_noi.lib.users.models.OtherUsers` doesn't yet look well:

  .. image:: 0907.png
     
  At least the comboboxes should be plain fields because the trigger
  buttons make no sense in a readonly form.

  The idea of such a a non editable detail_layout is that we abuse the
  ExtJS form layout machinery for displaying read-only information.  I
  started to work on this, but interrupted without success so far.  An
  alternative would be use a template or manually constructed
  xmlgen.html element tree, but that would be less Lino-like.
  
- Simple users may not edit the :attr:`assigned_to` field of a ticket
- Simple users may not see AvailableWorkers of a ticket
- Tickets should be duplicable
- The âœ‰ button on a user (send welcome message) must be only for
  SiteAdmin .

- The âœ‰ button on a user should open a dialog window in order to send
  a message to that user. That is, we might extend
  :mod:`lino.modlib.notify` to become an instant messaging system. An
  exciting idea.
  I added already a field `Notification.from_user`.

- Add an action for AnonymousUser to register as a new user. Probably
  we will then also need a field User.state (requested, rejected,
  accepted, confirmed, deactivated, banned, ...)

- User story : two simple users A and B. A writes a plea #1. B clicks
  AssignToMe, but then does not no what he promised. When A decides to
  no longer wait for B, she should rate plea #1, giving it the lowest
  rate, then duplicate it to submit the same text as a new plea.
