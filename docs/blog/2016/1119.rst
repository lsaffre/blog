Ticket :ticket:`1273` was caused by an unused virtual field `result`
(used by no layout). The solution was simple: remove that vrtual
field.

But why did the error happen on the production site and not in our
test suite?  I verified that the `polls.Polls` table is being shown in
:ref:`welfare.specs.polls`.  So why did it not happen there? Answer:
because the dangling field was not being evaluated there. But it *is*
being evaluated by the :mod:`lino.modlib.extjs` renderer.  So I wrote
a new utility function :func:`walk_menu_items
<lino.api.doctests.walk_menu_items>` which would have seen this error
I added to the specs of :ref:`voga` and :ref:`welfare`.
