I did an upgrade on demo@lf


I removed :mod:`lino_cosi.lib.declarations` from the installed apps of
:ref:`cosi`.  This is a first step for :ticket:`711`, knowing that I
will reimplement VAT declarations when :ticket:`736` is done.

I started the new plugin :mod:`lino.modlib.summaries`. It is a plugin
because it adds at least one menu command "Update all summary tables".
I would like to have this general functionality defined there. Note
that we can have more than one Summary models in an single application
(e.g. fse.Dossier and vat.Declaration). 

One question is how to define and handle the periods.  This is general
business logic, but needs to be customizable at least by the
application developer.  Every concrete model which inherits from
`Summary` needs a class attribute for selecting "monthly", "yearly" or
even some other user-defined periodic system.
