I started to work on ticket :ticket:`1072`.  After reading the guides
about `Grids
<http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/6.0.2-classic/guides/components/grids.html>`__
and `Events
<http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/6.0.2-classic/guides/core_concepts/events.html>`__
I thought:

- Shouldn't Lino also generate a Model for every store?
- They say "Grid panel has built-in support for editing. Let's look at
  the two main editing modes - row editing and cell editing."
