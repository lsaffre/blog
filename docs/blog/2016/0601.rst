ValueError: day is out of range for month
=========================================

:ticket:`956` : There was a time bomb in Lino:
:class:`lino.mixins.perios.Monthly` caused a :message:`ValueError: day
is out of range for month` in :ref:`voga`. Alexa and Monique would not
have been able to work today if I hadn't noticed this.


UndefinedError: 'unicode' is undefined
======================================

This was happening in the :ref:`lino.tutorial.polls`.
I guess that Hamza (or the future script?) removed the `unicode` from 
:meth:`get_printable_context <lino.core.model.Model.get_printable_context>`
