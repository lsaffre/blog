===========================

I adapted the calendar event workflow in :ref:`welfare` to the new
look using `button_text` instead of `icon_name`. This became necessary
now that the button_text of a state is inherited by transition action.

And another little challenge which lead to yet another magic feature:
I would like to remove the ticket state "sticky" from :ref:`care`.
This is a situation where it is clear that we do not want to rewrite
the whole workflow. We really just want to remove that one state. So I
added a :meth:`remove <lino.core.choicelists.Choice.remove>` method to
:class:`lino.core.choicelists.Choice`.  This approach is less trivial
than it might sound.  For example we need to avoid error messages when
adding a workflow action which specifies "sticky" in `allowed_states`.

I wrote (in :mod:`lino_noi.lib.noi.migrate`) the migrator for
converting `assigned_to` into vote objects.

I comitted and pushed the changes of the last days.
