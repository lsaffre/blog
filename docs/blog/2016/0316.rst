Working on Lino Welfare accounting project
==========================================

I did an upgrade to testlino@cpaseupen and launched :manage:`cpas2lino`
in order to evaluate the results with Gerd.

Working on Lino Voga documentation
==================================

I started to add some content to the Voga functional specification:
:ref:`voga.specs.courses`.

The Lino test suite has 34% of coverage
=======================================

I merged Hamza's work (`Lino PR 36
<https://github.com/lino-framework/lino/pull/36>`_ and `Atelier PR 16
<https://github.com/lsaffre/atelier/pull/16>`__) into master.

Hamza, I undid your change in :mod:`lino.core.store.ComboStoreField`::

    # return (v, i[1].encode('utf8'))
    return (v, i[1])

because I don't understand why you did this.

And then... yes, finally! :ticket:`824` (a follow-up of :ticket:`463`)
is done!  For the first time in my life I see a realistic coverage
report for Lino. Thanks to Sandeep who was primary motor and
contributor.

:ticket:`824` and :ticket:`832` are done.
The next step is now to increase our percentage.


Upgrade in cpaschatelet
=======================

Just a quick release because of :ticket:`833`.
En passant I did :ticket:`821`.
