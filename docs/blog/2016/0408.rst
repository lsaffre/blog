=====================

When generating invoices, Lino failed to use the value for the
`Invoicing date` (:attr:`today
<lino_cosi.lib.invoicing.models.Plan.today>`) specified in the plan.
I fixed the bug (in :meth:`create_invoic
e
<lino_cosi.lib.invoicing.models.Item.create_invoice>`).

I merged Hamza's fix for :ticket:`802`.

I deployed these changes to ref:`eiche`.

Today I travelled from Vigala to Eupen where I will be during the
coming two weeks.
