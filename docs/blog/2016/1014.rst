I fixed a bug which occured when trying to export a table with an
:class:`IncompleteDateField <lino.core.fields.IncompleteDateField>` to
Excel or `.ods`.  For example the :attr:`birth_date
<lino.mixins.human.Born.birth_date>`.  Lino said :message:`ValueError:
Cannot convert 1973-07-21 to Excel` and produced no file.
    
I added a test case which reproduces the problem in
:ref:`lino.specs.export_excel`. For this I had to add French to the
list of `languages` for :mod:`lino_book.projects.min2`.
