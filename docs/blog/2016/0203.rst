Ticket :ticket:`143` is coming
==============================

This morning I had yet another important meeting, this time with
Wilfried and about :ticket:`143`.  Results: we are almost there.  All
conceptual differences between TIM and Lino are well done and
acceptable for the users.  Most required points of the planned
prototype are done.  Some minor to-does:

- Tabelle mit Buchungsperioden
- Neue Journalgruppe "Zahlungsaufträge".
- Die Dokumentnummer eines Belegs (Voucher.number) muss prominenter
  gezeigt werden und die interne ID zurückhaltender.
- Upgrade their testlino site. 
- Buchungen 2016 aus TIM importieren

- `partner` : change verbose_name from "Partner" to "Recipient"
  ("Empfänger"). This label is theoretically not correct, but in Lino
  Welfare accounting there will be almost only expenses and no
  incomes.


Yet another new aspirant contributor
====================================

We welcome `James
<https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-m-miller-23885323>`_, a Python
enthusiast from Ohio living in Japan, who plans to join the core
developer team as a volunteer in the hope of learning to get coding on
a real project.

For Princewell and James I updated the following introductory pages:
