===========================

:ref:`jo` asked me to build a http service for accessing the data in a
:ref:`care` database so that he can build a sexy and reactive user
interface around it.

I wrote :mod:`lino.modlib.restful`, an adapter to the `Django REST
framework <http://www.django-rest-framework.org/>`_.  A first usage is
:mod:`lino_noi.projects.team.urls` (currently exposing just a few
fields as a proof of concept).

As a side effect, we have a new field `last_login
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/contrib/auth/#django.contrib.auth.models.User.last_login>`_
because Lino now inherits from Django's `AbstractBaseUser`. I have no
idea why we would need this field, but I could remove three methods
from my code which I previously had copied from Django's User model.

As expected, the authentication does not work out of the box since
Lino replaces Django's permission model. This will require more
investigation.

TODO:

- Write a :meth:`ChoiceListField.serialize` method.
- Get authentication and permissions to work.
