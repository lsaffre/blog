Moved three demo projects
=========================

I moved three demo projects from :mod:`lino_cosi.projects` to
:mod:`lino_book.projects`:

- :mod:`lino_book.projects.apc`
- :mod:`lino_book.projects.pierre`
- :mod:`lino_book.projects.cosi_ee` (previously :mod:`lino_book.projects.ylle`)
     
This is mainly because these projects depend :mod:`commondata`, a
useless dependency for normal production sites.  Also they are merely
localizations of :mod:`lino_cosi.projects.std` and more useful as
examples for local :xfile:`settings.py` modifications.

I also moved some tested documents (:ref:`book.specs.cosi_ee` and
:ref:`book.specs.ajax`) from Cosi to Book because they rely on these
demo projects.
