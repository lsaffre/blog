==========================

I committed my work on :ticket:`739`.  The main work was to add a
new sample file, which I got by garbling a real request.

The problem itself was because Lino was using an obsolete version of
the XML schema files (:xfile:`RetrieveTIGroups.xsd` and
:xfile:`rn25_Release201411.xsd`) when communicating with the CBSS.
Thanks to :ref:`sante` who helped me to find the latest version of
these files.

In a second commit I added two more samples in order to test and fix
:ticket:`1150` and :ticket:`1159` (a missing handler and a minor
problem in :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.cbss.tx25`).

And the content of every Tx25 sample is now shown and tested in
:ref:`welfare.specs.tx25`.
