A little change for Lino Voga in `column_names` of
:class:`lino_voga.projects.roger.lib.courses.Pupils`.  And some
translations were missing.

And another change request turned out to be more tricky: they want
:class:`CoursesByTopic <lino_voga.lib.courses.models.CoursesByTopic>`
to show only *active* courses. But adding this condition to
:meth:`param_defaults <lino.core.actors.Actor.param_defaults>` did not
have any effect.  That was because
:class:`lino_xl.lib.courses.ui.CoursesByTopic` redefined
:meth:`get_request_queryset
<lino.core.dbtables.Table.get_request_queryset>` without calling
:func:`super`.  And actually the "good" method for doing what this
table wants to do (namely to link to a *remote field on the master*
instead of linking directly to the master) is to write a custom
:meth:`get_filter_kw <lino.core.tables.AbstractTable.get_filter_kw>`
method.
