Yesterday we discovered a subtle but maybe important problem for
:ticket:`143`: manually entered AAW get their amounts totalled into a
negative sum.

missing feature 
in Lino Welfare we can have clearing on the same
booking direction.

The primary booking of an incoming invoice (REG) is usually DEBIT.
The primary booking of a disbursement order (AAW) is *also* usually DEBIT.
And an AAW satisfies (clears) a REG.


I removed the message "List contains more than 900 rows". The idea was
to protect users from inadvertently produce huge pdf files. But it is
very disturbing to get this message during a demonstration :-)

New field :attr:`lino_xl.lib.ledger.models.Journal.yearly_numbering`.

All vouchers are now certifiable.  IOW
:class:`lino_xl.lib.ledger.models.Voucher` no inherits from
:class:`lino_xl.lib.excerpts.mixins.Certifiable`.
I am not 100% sure whether this was a good idea.
