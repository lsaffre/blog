=====================

I merged Hamza's work for :ticket:`967` into master of :ref:`cosi` and
:ref:`lino`, and his work for :ticket:`966` into :mod:`lino_extjs6`.

I committed my yesterday's work (despite the fact that many unit tests
are probably broken after my changes to the demo fixtures).

I noticed that :attr:`suggest_future_vouchers
<lino_xl.lib.finan.Plugin.suggest_future_vouchers>` was being
applied only when suggesting per *voucher* and ignored when suggesting
per voucher *item*. Fixed.
