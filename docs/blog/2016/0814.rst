Lino Care moving forward
========================

During a meeting with :ref:`annalisa` we identified a few new things
for :ref:`care`:

- The "simple" user profile must have access to a very limited
  functionality. They plan to invite many people to register as simple
  users and to enter their pleas.
  
- A new table "Where I can help"
  :class:`lino_noi.lib.tickets.ui.SuggestedTickets`

- And one thing which looks tiny but caused a rather big series of
  code changes: in :ref:`care` we need an action to say "I want to
  assign this ticket to me". I noted that a field `assigned_to` was
  defined on both :class:`lino_noi.lib.tickets.models.Ticket` and
  :class:`lino_xl.lib.cal.Event`. This field is now defined in
  the new :class:`lino.modlib.users.mixins.Assignable` mixin.

  Until now, if an application wanted to have the `take` action on its
  calendar events, it had to simply import a module
  ``lino_xl.lib.cal.workflows.take``::

     from lino_xl.lib.cal.workflows import take

  This module no longer exists, and I moved away from this approach
  (it is still there for
  :mod:`lino_xl.lib.cal.workflows.feedback`). This approach is
  deprecated because it has at least one disadvantage: you cannot
  remove it once it has been imported.

  The new approach is the :class:`lino.modlib.users.mixins.Assignable`
  mixin in combination with two new user roles
  :class:`lino.modlib.users.roles.Helper` and
  :class:`lino.modlib.users.roles.AuthorshipTaker`.


Bugfix : GridEdit.select_rows is now `False` (it was `True`)  



Lino at FOSDEM 2017
===================

I submitted a request for a devroom at `FOSDEM 2017
<https://www.fosdem.org/2017/>`__:

Title: **Getting started with Lino**

Description:

    I would give a short overview of the `Lino framework
    <http://www.lino-framework.org/>`__, write a few example
    applications, and if participants bring ideas, maybe we will
    create a new application from scratch. Participants can get
    started on their own by reading http://www.lino-framework.org/dev/
    before the event and get further support during FOSDEM.

Coordinator's affinity to the topic of the devroom:

    Luc is the author of the framework

Why does it fit FOSDEM:

    Lino is a young expanding framework being used on 5 production
    sites, 4 of them in Belgium. The framework is designed for
    professional developers who write customized database applications
    for their customers or employer.


Listing your projects
=====================

I removed the :cmd:`inv ls` command and added a ``--list`` option to
:cmd:`per_project`.  Because that's where this functionality has its
right place.
