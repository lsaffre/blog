I plan to write a report about my own activity during the last year.
Today, as a first step, I started by assigning a project to those
tickets which didn't yet have one, and by tidying up our project list.
Including a bugfix :message`global name 'join_elems' is not defined`,
some UI optimizations in :ref:`noi`, and a release to :ref:`lf`.
