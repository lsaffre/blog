===================================

Hamza added a picture link to Travis in the READEME of atelier.  When
trying to build the atelier docs I noticed that this won't work
because that file is being overwritten by each documentation
build. With Atelier, the README file should not be edited directly. It
is automatically generated from the `description` in `SETUP_INFO`.

I committed a first alternative.  Yet another alternative would be to
include the travis link to :file:`docs/.templates/links.html`.
