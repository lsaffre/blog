Today I hope to get :manage:`linod` running as daemon.

Daemon processes
================

Yesterday I noted that :mod:`lino.utils.daemoncommand` "does not
collaborarte well with newer Django versions", but meanwhile I surfed
around, it seems that the problem is much more complex.

I found `Supervisor <http://www.supervisord.org/introduction.html>`__

It seems that my bash script templates and docs about
`admin.linod` are obsolete.

Getting started with Lino
=========================

:ref:`james` asked "why create a special directory for virtualenv
which is segragated from the project directory?". I updated the
:ref:`dev.install` guide in the hope that it now gives a satisfying
answer to his concerns.
