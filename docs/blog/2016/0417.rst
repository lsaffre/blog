Yesterday Alexa and I registered the first bank statement into a Lino
production site. The experience was rather pleasant. With two
observations.


The :attr:`balance2
<lino_xl.lib.finan.models.BankStatement.balance2>` of a bank
statement is computed automatically and therefore must have
`blank=True`. And I even removed it from the `insert_layout` because
people should not worry about it at that moment.

More important was the problem that Lino wrote an expense when
accepting a suggested payment of a sales invoice. So I now wrote
documentation for the primary booking direction of a journal
(:attr:`dc <lino_xl.lib.ledger.models.Journal.dc>`), which lead me
to do some more subtle changes about this famous `dc` field.
