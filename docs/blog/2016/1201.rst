Voting
======

I wrote a new plugin :mod:`lino_noi.lib.votes` which is going to
replace :mod:`lino_xl.lib.stars` (:ticket:`831`).  And it is also
going to implement what Johannes and I called "ticket help offers"
(:ticket:`1285`) on :doc:`last Friday <1125>`.

The first description of this idea was:

    A new plugin "votes" : users can manage their "wish lists". A wish
    is when a given user has an opinion about a given ticket (a
    personal priority and an optional remark). There is at most 1 wish
    per user and ticket. This is similar to the existing stars
    plugin. But unlike a star it is not a simple on/off toggle. And
    then I wouldn't use a GFK but a simple FK to an app-specific model
    (the Plugin.voted_model).  Also a new field `voting_weight` per
    user - this would enable us to automatically compute the
    priorities of a todo list!

Code changes:

- New package :mod:`lino_noi.lib.votes`
- Moved the :attr:`rating <lino_noi.lib.votes.models.Vote.rating>`
  field from Ticket to Vote.
- Adapted some dependencies and test suites in :ref:`presto`.
- Wrote a migrator which converts existing `stars.Star` objects into
  `votes.Vote` objects.
  
- Started using new date-based versioning system: 2016.12.0
  
TODO:

- Voters should be notification recipients.
  
Miscellaneous
=============

- Fixed a bug causing an error message after creating Enrolment
- Fixed a bug in new dashboard caused by StatusReport not having
  preview_limit
- The :manage:`initdb` command now works on InnoDB tables (sets
  `foreign_key_checks` to 0 before running :manage:`migrate` and
  :manage:`loaddata`).


Fixed the duplicate entry bug
=============================

I reproduced (in :mod:`lino_voga.projects.voga2.tests.test_faggio`)
and fixed a bug which was probably the main reason for :ticket:`1280`:
when the *first* automatic event of a series had been manually
rescheduled to another date, then the second lesson came on that date
a well (instead of getting the next available date).

Deployed :ref:`voga` 2016.12.0 to :ref:`eiche`.

In order to reproduce it, I also tried to run their data on my
machine. Which revealed :ticket:`1293`::
  
  django.db.utils.OperationalError: (1193, "Unknown system variable 'storage_engine'")


Setting up a new VPS
====================

:ticket:`1294` (AH01630: client denied by server configuration) :
        
This message in the Apache :xfile:`error.log` came because I had
copied an Apache 2.2 config file to an Apache 2.4 system.  With Apache
2.4 the conf files need upgrading.  See [url
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/upgrading.html#run-time].
