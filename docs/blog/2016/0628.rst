:class:`ItemsByInvoicePrintNoQtyColumn
<lino_cosi.lib.sales.models.ItemsByInvoicePrintNoQtyColumn>`
now has :attr:`hide_sums` set to `False`. Indeed this
information was useless because the sum is being printed anyway afterwards. And in invoices with only one item it was even ugly.


In :xfile:`item_description.html` we have::

    {{_("Time")}}: {{obj.course.weekdays_text}} {{obj.course.times_text}}.

This lead to an ugly text in case of one-event courses:

    Zeit: Jeden 0. Dienstag 09:00-18:30.
    
This was because
:attr:`lino_xl.lib.cal.mixins.RecurrenceSet.weekdays_text` is far from
covering all situations and far from being well-tested.  I made it a
bit better and added some examples in :ref:`book.specs.cal`.

TODO: discuss with Roger and Monique about more 
features in :xfile:`item_description.html`


Alexa reported :ticket:`998`: Yes, it is perfectly okay to write an
invoice for an enrolment which starts in the future.  But at least for
our demo fixtures we don't want invoices for enrolments in the future.
This was in
:meth:`lino_voga.lib.courses.models.Enrolment.get_invoiceable_product`

Probably fixed.
