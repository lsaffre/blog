I worked on :ticket:`901`: 
Added a second column layout for the items of a sales invoice.

Added a new database field
:attr:`lino_xl.lib.products.models.Product.delivery_unit`

The appy instruction used in `sales/VatProductInvoice/Default.odt`
template for rendering the "body" of the invoice was until now::

    do text
    from table(rt.models.sales.ItemsByInvoicePrint.request(this.owner))

Now it is::

    do text
    from table(obj.get_print_items(ar))

Note the new internal attribute :attr:`print_items_table
<lino_xl.lib.sales.models.VatProductInvoice.print_items_table>`.

Lino (:mod:`lino_xl.lib.invoicing.models`) did not select the
correct language when generating invoice items. 

Converted some text constants which had been hard-coded German until
now to translatable texts.  Updated German translations.
