=================================

I merged Hamza's work in :ref:`book`, then repaired myself some links,
then worked for :ticket:`39`.

The important thing seems to be :file:`/docs/build-requirements.txt`


No module named commondata.utils
================================

I saw this error message first on readthedocs, and could reproduce it
on my machine by installing the PyPI version of
:mod:`commondata.ee`::

  $ python -m commondata.utils
  /path/to/python: No module named commondata.utils

Yes, I usually work with the development versions of all commondata
modules.

I released version 0.0.2 of commondata to PyPI.

Afterwards I triggered a manual build which produced again an error
:message:`No matching distribution found for PIL==1.1.7 (from -r
docs/build-requirements.txt (line 6))`. This error seems to occur
"randomly" and to come from an old version
