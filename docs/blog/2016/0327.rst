The :message:`No account in (journal)` warning during
:meth:`get_wanted_movements
<lino_xl.lib.ledger.models.Voucher.get_wanted_movements>` must raise
a :class:`Warning` (not an :class:`Exception`).

When a :class:`Warning` is raised during a callback (e.g. after a
confirmation), then a :class:`Warning` was being treated as an
internal server error instead of being displayed to the user.  This
was a bug in :meth:`lino.core.kernel.Kernel.run_callback`.

I renamed `satisfied` to :attr:`cleared
<lino_xl.lib.ledger.models.Movement.cleared>` on
:class:`lino_xl.lib.ledger.models.Movement`.

New setting :attr:`lino_xl.lib.ledger.Plugin.force_cleared_until` is
needed because they want to import old disbursements only, supposing
they are all cleared.
