=========================

I made yet another after-release to weleup (:ticket:`643`). Which made
me discover that I must define a :class:`LedgerStaff
<lino_welfare.modlib.welfare.roles.LedgerStaff>` class for Welfare as
well.

Static website generators with web interface
============================================

In December, Armin Ronacher presented his static website generator
`Lektor <http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2015/12/21/introducing-lektor/>`_.
Which I tried locally on my notbook. Cool.

Now I also stumbled over `ikiwiki <http://ikiwiki.info/>`_, a simple
but interesting blog/wiki system which provides static files and uses
git. This one is written in Perl, however. My hello world blog is
visible at http://ikiblog.lino-framework.org

TODO: Is it possible to setup a Lektor host, i.e. Lektor running on my
VPS? And is it possible then to do what ikiwiki does: let *me* edit a
site using emacs on a cloned repository, while *others* can edit the
same site using the web interface?
