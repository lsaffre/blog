Lino on Docker
==============

Congratulations to :ref:`subha` who published a first `Docker
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)>`_ repository for a
:ref:`noi` instance:
     
     https://hub.docker.com/r/subhapy/lino_tutorial/

Do not yet try it on your own (there are some last details to be fixed
before we can close :ticket:`1176`), but this is a promising proof of
concept for the idea of deploying Lino applications for
:ref:`independent hosters <lino.hosters>`.
