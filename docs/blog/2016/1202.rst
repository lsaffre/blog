Two deployments at the same time
================================

My mum always tells me to never run two deployments at the same time,
at least not when you have only 15 minutes. Yesterday I did exactly
this.

Now I noticed that the deployment on our own :ref:`noi` database had a
problem:

- votes.Vote (1048, "Column 'created' cannot be null") (58 object(s)
  with primary key 41, 73, 100, 96, 97, 98, 99, 58, 59, 86, 87, 39,
  102, 53, 25, 64, 56

So my starred tickets had not been migrated correctly.  I decided to
re-run the :xfile:`restore.py` now because the few changes I did after
this upgrade are less work than restoring the votes manually.

I did not see this problem yesterday because of an old logging
problem: the warnings emitted are written to :xfile:`lino.log` but not
to the console. This problem had arrived with some Django upgrade.  I
now found the reason and fixed it: I must remove the
'require_debug_true' filter from the 'console' handler in Django's
default logging config.  I have no idea why Django has such a strange
behaviour as default... :ticket:`1295`.

This fix for :ticket:`1295` probably caused the following warnings to
no longer pass unseen::

    .../django/db/models/fields/__init__.py:1393: RuntimeWarning: DateTimeField Ticket.created received a naive datetime (2015-02-22 00:00:00) while time zone support is active.

    Cannot update unresolved field <class 'lino_xl.lib.excerpts.models.Excerpt'>.company


This package should not be accessible on Python 3

A mysterious error happens::

    =================== 1 passed, 17 deselected in 4.89 seconds ====================

The problem seems to be caused by my good old enemy `future
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/future>`__, especially when I read
things like this:

  https://github.com/PythonCharmers/python-future/issues/148

I removed the following lines from most places::

    from future import standard_library
    standard_library.install_aliases()

To be honest, I must add that the `newstr` trick of `future
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/future>`__ is AFAICS still the only
solution for getting our doctests to pass on both Py 2 and 3.

Note also that I did not run the full test suite under Python 3 (I
stopped when I had a problem with appy).


Adapting the tests
==================

The changes in output behaviour during test due to the console output
being visible at places where it wasn't before, the "This package
should not be accessible on Python 3" problem, caused me another 3
hours over midnight session for adapting the tests suites...
