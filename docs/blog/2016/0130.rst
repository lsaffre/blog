A PyQt user interface for Lino
==============================

I created :ticket:`761`, which is actually a rather old idea of mine.
It woke up when I read that Martin Fitzpatrick wrote a book `Create
Simple GUI Applications
<https://leanpub.com/create-simple-gui-applications/read#leanpub-auto-introduction>`_
which might be a good starting point. It is available online for free.
I liked very much his formulation of the difference between free and
proprietary software:

  **GPL Only** Note that the following instructions are only for
  installation of the GPL licensed version of PyQt. If you need to use
  PyQt in a non-GPL project you will need to purchase an alternative
  license from Riverbank Computing in order to release your software.


Lino Noi
========

Lightness of being: today I accidentally fixed a rather unimportant
issue :ticket:`762` (Worked hours when only unfinised finished
sessions) -- as if I had nothing else to do ;-)

Lino Welfare
============

I merged Hamza's work for :ticket:`759` and made an upgrade to
cpaschatelet. This was a historic moment because :ticket:`759` is the first
ticket which was solved entirely by Hamza without my
help. Congratulations.

The Lino Welfare test suite had two trivial failures due to my changes
of last Wednesday.
