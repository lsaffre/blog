20 years of accounting data
===========================

Lino's elder brother `TIM <https://github.com/lsaffre/tim>`_ is being
used since 1996 at the PCSW of Eupen.  Their database contains two
decades of data and has seen both the `Y2K

switch from `BEF <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_franc>`_ to
`Euro <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro>`_.  Today we celebrated
that birthday with a relaxed meeting in the staff dining room. In a
short speech Luc remembered some important moments of his life with
TIM, Lino and their users.
