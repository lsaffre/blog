=====================================

I pulled Hamza's work on :ticket:`357` into the master (of
:mod:`atelier` and :ref:`cosi`).

And then I "accidentally" worked for 2 hours on it, converting the
``bd`` task.  I thought that this would be trivial, but there are
dragons.  The ``env`` object from Fabric has been functionally
replaced by a complex (and cool) approach using a `context
<http://docs.pyinvoke.org/en/0.12.0/concepts/context.html>`_ and
"collections" of tasks.  In a first step I continue to emulate the
``env`` object as an :class:`AttrDict <atelier.utils.AttrDict>`.

I continued to work on :ticket:`353`, see the changes in :ref:`cosi`.
