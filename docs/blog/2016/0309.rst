HTML report for test coverage
=============================

Sandeep suggested to add the following line to
:func:`atelier.invlib.run_tests_coverage`::

  cov.html_report(include=cov.get_data().measured_files())

Of course. Good idea, Sandeep! I extended it a bit::

    htmlcov = ctx.root_dir.child('htmlcov')
    if htmlcov.exists():
        print("Writing html report to %s" % htmlcov)
        cov.html_report(include=cov.get_data().measured_files())

That is: the html report get's created only when a directory
named :xfile:`htmlcov` exists.

More about test coverage
========================


I also saw that `inv cov` did not not use the `test_suite` specified
in the project's :xfile:`setup.py` but discovered test cases in the
project's `root_dir`. In simple projects the result is the same.

I tried :cmd:`inv cov` on Lino (after adding a :xfile:`.coveragerc`
file)

This revealed a problem which I had seen with Hamza before (and that
day Hamza had explained me how to work around it)::

  TypeError: object.__new__(NotImplementedType) is not safe, use NotImplementedType.__new__()

I guess that we must remove the necessity of having `current_project`
in our `ctx` for invoke.

But even after fixing this, :cmd:`inv cov` in Lino still says "No data
collected".
