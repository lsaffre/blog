======================

The links generated by memo command ``[url ...]`` (See
:ref:`noi.specs.memo`) will now always open in a new window
(``target="_blank"``).

I **deactivated** the following :cmd:`fab` commands because their
:cmd:`inv` variant can now be considered stable and usable:
:cmd:`inv ci`
:cmd:`inv bd`
:cmd:`inv pd`
:cmd:`inv mm`
:cmd:`inv clean`
:cmd:`inv blog`
:cmd:`inv test`
:cmd:`inv cov`

I generalized the ``pty=True`` trick for all shell commands invoked by
*invoke* (see :func:`atelier.invlib.local`).  Because I was missing
colors in :cmd:`inv ci`.

I noticed that :ticket:`839` is *not fixed* by the ``pty=True`` trick.

  I added an RSS stream for my blog:
  <a type="application/rss+xml" href="http://luc.lino-framework.org/rss.xml"><img src="http://luc.lino-framework.org/_static/feed-icon-16.gif" title="RSS feed"/></a>

At 6pm I wanted to finally start working on :ticket:`143`. But
accidentally I had an idea for :ref:`inv_commands` which seemed a
quick win.  And it *was* a quick win: for the first time I am
satisfied with the invoke integration into Atelier.  I also started to
care for the documentation.

Since this was change in the API, it required a change in the
:xfile:`tasks.py` file of all my projects.  And thus yet another
release on PyPI.  Which I named version 1.0.0 (and not 0.0.21).

So no new accounting stuff in :ticket:`143` tonight... this reminds me
an anecdote from the Tao of Programming:

    A novice programmer was once assigned to code a simple financial
    package.

    The novice worked furiously for many days, but when his Master
    reviewed his program, he discovered it contained a screen editor, a
    set of generalized graphics routines, and an artificial intelligence
    interface, but not the slightest hint of anything financial.

    When the Master asked about this, the novice became indignant. "Don't
    be so impatient," he said, "I'll put in the financial stuff
    eventually."
