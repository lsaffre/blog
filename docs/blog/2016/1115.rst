Avaaz impressed me, they started a campaign which `questions
themselves
<https://secure.avaaz.org/campaign/en/global_citizen_summit/>`__. I
didn't imagine that this might happen one day. I told them my opinion:


    Avaaz has a fundamental problem: their principal goal is to move the
    masses. This goal is partly in conflict with goals like "Promote
    peace", "Search for truth" etc.

    Suggestion: every campaign should take care to also document "the
    other side", those who did not sign, and why. Without this you have no
    chance to become the voice of humanity. Switch your song from single
    voice to a polyphonic song.

But I don't believe that they will seriously consider what I told
them...
