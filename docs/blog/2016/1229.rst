Today I committed the work I did during the Christmas holidays for the
:ref:`care` project (tickets :ticket:`1285` and :ticket:`1304`).
Here is (or will be) an overview of these changes.

- New module :mod:`lino.modlib.restful` and
  :mod:`lino_noi.projects.team.urls` which uses it. This is just a proof
  of concept.
  
- New field :attr:`User.last_login
  <lino.modlib.users.models.User.last_login>` as a side effect of
  above. Also :mod:`lino.modlib.users.forms` and
  :mod:`lino.modlib.users.views`.
  
- New module :mod:`lino_xl.lib.excerpts.roles` which defines the new
  roles ExcerptsUser and ExcerptsStaff because simple users in
  :ref:`care` never print excerpts and don't want to see a menu
  command "My excerpts". Because this functionality had been covered
  by OfficeUser and OfficeStaff so far, I had to adapt the roles
  definitions in noi, cosi, presto, voga, welfare
