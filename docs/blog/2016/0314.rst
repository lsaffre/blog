I started to meditate about whether and how I can give back my work on
Appy to the community. The author did not yet answer to my mail.

According to `Appy ticket #130346
<https://answers.launchpad.net/appy/+question/130346>`__ (Python 3 ?),
the appy framework does work under Python 3.  But we don't know
whether this is true because Appy has neither a :xfile:`setup.py`
script nor a test suite.
