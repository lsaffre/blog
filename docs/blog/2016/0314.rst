======================

In a two hour voice session with Hamza we found the explanation!
Appy is innocent!
ElementTree and Appy just don't support `future.newstr`.

If you use one of these and want to support both 2 and 3, then avoid
`newstr` and use `six.text_type` instead.

In case of doubt I recommend to replace all these `future` shortcuts
by their six equivalent . 
python-future is a higher-level compatibility layer than six
Explicit is better than implicit.
