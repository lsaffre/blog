Contributions from three continents
===================================

Today I reviewed two pull requests, one submitted by :ref:`hamza`, the
other by :ref:`subha`.  I am glad that the Lino team has a third
active contributor. Subha is less experienced than Hamza and me, but
that's no problem, the important thing is that we have the same
wavelength so we can learn from each other, and I am optimistic about
this.

Lino Voga
=========

I added a new field :attr:`Course.paper_type
<lino_voga.lib.courses.models.Course.paper_type>` (needed for
:ticket:`1203`)

I installed the latest version at :ref:`eiche`.  And I set their
:attr:`ignore_dates_after <lino_xl.lib.cal.Plugin.ignore_dates_after>`
to `i2d(20171231)`

The following error occured (of course) when restoring the snapshot::
   
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "manage.py", line 6, in <module>
      ...
      File "snapshot/restore.py", line 1157, in <module>
      File "snapshot/restore.py", line 1114, in main
      File "users_user.py", line 4, in <module>
        loader.save(create_users_user(u'5',dt(2016,5,2,11,29,32),dt(2016,1,25,17,39,47),... None,True))
      File "snapshot/restore.py", line 556, in create_users_user
    AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'UserProfiles'

I did not write a migrator for this because I just needed to modify
the :file:`snapshot/restore.py` script at the given line, replacing
UserProfiles by UserTypes.
      
Five enrolments had a little problem::

I did not investigate this further...
