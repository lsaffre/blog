======================

I worked on :ticket:`926` (SlaveSummary for EventsByCourse):
 
- The :class:`CourseDetail <lino_voga.lib.cal.models.CourseDetail>` in
  :ref:`voga` now uses the new class :class:`EventsByCourse
  <lino_voga.lib.cal.models.EventsByCourse>` instead of
  :class:`EventsByController <lino_xl.lib.cal.ui.EventsByController>`.


Lino Presto Ã  la Daniel
=======================

I finally started to dive into :ticket:`897`.

My customer SPZ are currently running an application written in TIM
(Lino's predecessor) and they are actually very happy with TIM. But
they are also motivated to migrate to Lino, and they will actively
help by testing everything. They have their own inhouse server and a
system administrator, so hosting is no additional burden for me.

It seems to me that now is the right time to work on a prototype for
them. It will be a combination of :ref:`cosi` and :ref:`noi`.

I started the functional specs overview (:ref:`presto.specs.daniel`)
and first code changes:

- The code name for this prototype is
  :mod:`lino_presto.projects.daniel`.  I removed the
  :mod:`lino_presto.projects.mini` package because it is no longer
  needed.

- :mod:`lino_noi.lib.clocking` has a new
  :attr:`ticket_model <lino_noi.lib.clocking.Plugin.ticket_model>`. 
  For Daniel this will point to the *dossier*.

- I moved some functionality from :mod:`lino_noi.lib.clocking` to a
  new module :mod:`lino_noi.projects.team.lib.clocking`:
  namely the parts which make sense only when
  also :mod:`lino_noi.lib.tickets`  is installed.
