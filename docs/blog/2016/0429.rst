Software craftsmanship
======================

Thanks to Yves who confirmed my recommendation of preferring
``print(foo)`` over ``print (foo)`` (see :doc:`0425`).  Yves also
pointed me to the very interesting concept of `Software craftsmanship
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship>`_ which
expresses what I have been practising all my professional life and
what I formulated (on `my company's website
<https://www.saffre-rumma.net/views/>`_) as "We believe that writing
good software is an *art*, and that software developers should work
and get paid like *artists*".  That's also the origin of the name of
my :mod:`atelier` package (*atelier*, in French, is used both for the
studio of an artist and for the workshop of a craftsman).

Lino is certainly not perfect regarding `Clean Code
<https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Code>`_, but it is a perfect
example of people who *try* to write clean code in a complex reality
;-) And I observed that at the age of 47 I still prefer writing
*myself* clean code over writing *about writing* clean code.

I continued to work on :class:`EnrolmentsAndPaymentsByCourse
<lino_voga.lib.courses.models.EnrolmentsAndPaymentsByCourse>`. I start
to get satisfied...
