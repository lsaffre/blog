Tonight Hamza did an upgrade on :ref:`lf` all on his own. While I was
sleeping.  This was his first upgrade of a production site.

Yesterday I was a bit nervous and had revised and updated the general
instructions page :ref:`admin.upgrade`.

This morning I continued to work on :ticket:`584`.  I renamed ``fse``
to ``esf`` (because internal names are English, not French), so the
plugin is now named :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.esf`.  First visible
results for printing an EFS summary.
