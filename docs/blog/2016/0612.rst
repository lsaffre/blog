Replace OptionParser by ArgumentParser
======================================

Hamza worked on :ticket:`967`: the :manage:`initdb` command no longer
causes a `RemovedInDjango110Warning` :message:`OptionParser usage for
Django management commands is deprecated, use ArgumentParser instead`.

TODO: Hamza, can you please make the same conversion also for the
following other commands:

- :manage:`dump2py`
- :manage:`show`
- :manage:`checkdata`
- :manage:`garble_persons`
- :manage:`reregister`


I noticed that :manage:`garble_persons` was missing in :ref:`cosi` and
:ref:`welfare`.
