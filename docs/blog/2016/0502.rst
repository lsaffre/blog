:ref:`noi` test suite had some failures after recent changes for
:ticket:`621`.

Received and solved :ticket:`891`. This caused some
internal optimizations and documentation in 
:class:`lino.mixins.periods.DatePeriod` and
:class:`lino.modlib.system.choicelists.PeriodEvent`.

Changes to :ref:`welfare` test suite after these optimizations.

Minor changes in :ref:`voga` for :ticket:`892`.
