======================


I realized that parts of :mod:`lino.modlib.extjs` was still haunting
around even when the :attr:`default_ui` was set to
:mod:`lino_extjs6.extjs6`. Because Lino used a module
:mod:`lino.core.elems` which did::

  from lino.modlib.extjs.elems import create_layout_panel, create_layout_element

The current solution is only half a solution: a new attribute
``widgets`` of the ``SITE.kernel`` which is set (like
``extjs_renderer``) during :meth:`on_ui_init` of both plugins.

It's only half a solution because it causes :ref:`belref` or
:mod:`lino_noi.projects.public` to fail (because they don't use any
ExtJS at all).

So the test suites are now broken. I won't continue on it before
tomorrow.
