Notification API change
=======================

I continued to work on :ticket:`923`.
More changes in the API of the notification framework.

New choicelist :class:`lino.modlib.notify.choicelists.MailModes`.
The injected user field `notifyme_mode` is replaced by `mail_mode`


Changed :cmd:`inv initdb` to :cmd:`inv prep`
============================================

I did ticket :ticket:`1260` and renamed :cmd:`inv initdb` to :cmd:`inv
prep`.

TODO: update documentation

Miscellaneous
=============

I fixed yet another case of :message:`'NoneType' object has no
attribute 'splitlines'` AttributeError in :mod:`lino.core.diff`.


Optimizations for :ref:`care`
=============================

I continued on :ticket:`1281`: Added a quicklink `[My settings]`,
changed the layout of the insert window for submitting a new ticket.
   

And another bugfix in the core: :meth:`add_instance_action
<lino.core.menus.Menu.add_instance_action>` did not work when used as
a quick link (:meth:`setup_quicklinks
<lino.core.site.Site.setup_quicklinks>`)
