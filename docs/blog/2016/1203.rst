Today I tried to install a new Lino server for our own :ref:`noi`
database on a virgin Debian 8 VPS hosted by `Zone Media
<https://www.zone.ee/et/>`_).

It turned out that the 256KB of RAM included with the `VPS I
<https://www.zone.ee/et/pilveserveri-tellimine/?package=p1>`__ package
(9.12€/month) are not enough.  Actually this memory is just needed for
installing `lxml` and `weasyprint`. I tried the trick with a temporary
swapfile described `here
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24455238/lxml-installation-error-ubuntu-14-04-internal-compiler-error>`__,
but Zone Media are smart enough to disable swap files.  And while
9.12€/month was already not cheap, they are getting really expensive
if I want more RAM. So this is not a solution. At OVH I get a VPS with
2 GB of RAM for 2.99€/month.

Which showed me once more that it is time to think about my general
strategy.  Yes it's funny to set up Lino servers and compare the
different hosting providers, but actually I don't plan to ever sell
serious professional hosting, and neither Hamza nor me should waste
our time into this work. There are far enough professionals who can do
this much better than I will ever do. I should either talk with Abakus
and other partners about hosting for both my customers and myself.

So I started to review the :ref:`lino.admin`.
