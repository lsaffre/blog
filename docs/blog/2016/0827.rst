Today we (my family and I) will fly back home.  I wanted a paper copy
of our boarding passes, but without the lower part which contains only
publicity.  I installed `PyPDF2 <https://github.com/mstamy2/PyPDF2>`__
and wrote the following script:

.. literalinclude:: crop_boarding_pass.py

The script produced appearently what I want, but in the printout the
cropped area then showed up again. IOW it needs more work, but I won't
do this now since I have my paper copies for this time.
