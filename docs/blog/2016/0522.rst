More ideas about :ticket:`897`.

In :ref:`noi` we need to rename "products" to "topics" (or
"components" or something similar). And "interests" should not link to
a product but to a topic.  And we must move these concepts into a
plugin on its own. :mod:`lino_xl.lib.topics`.

And then these interests should be per *partner*, not per *site*. That
difference was not important in our use case of :ref:`noi`, but at
:ref:`spz` they need topics and interests without the concept of
sites.

Before creating the new plugin :mod:`lino_xl.lib.topics`, I noted that
many copyright headers in :mod:`lino_xl` were not yet adapted to the
fact that this package is licensed AGPL, not under the BSD.

And yes, in our database I'll need to create one partner per site
before running that migrator. And every new site will probably cause a
new partner as well because we usually have partners with only one
site.  Hmm... do I want that? I am not really sure, but am ready to
try it on the field.

For the existing :ref:`noi` sites we will then need a migrator 

- Load content from products.Product into the new topics.Topic table,
  and ProductCat into the new TopicGroup table.

- Interest.product becomes Interest.topic
- Interest.site.partner becomes Interest.partner and if the site has
  no partner, create one.
- Rename Faculty.product_cat to topic_group
- Rename Competence.product to Competence.topic
