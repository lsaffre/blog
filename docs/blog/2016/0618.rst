=======================

Today I did nothing else than adapting the test suites.  The test
suites of :ref:`cosi`, :ref:`welfare` and :ref:`voga` needed quite
some changes because the demo data has changed a lot. Now they pass
again.

I renamed the ``demo_bookings`` fixture of :mod:`lino_cosi.lib.finan`
to :mod:`payments <lino_cosi.lib.finan.fixtures.payments>`, and
replaced all occurences of ``demo_bookings`` in :attr:`demo_fixtures
<lino.core.site.Site.demo_fixtures>` by ``demo_bookings
payments``. This was needed because otherwise the payments fixture was
run before the fixtures that generated the causes for these payments.

Now that we have a separate fixture for payments, we can rename the
fixture which creates automatic invoices back from demo2 to
demo_bookings.

I removed the `lino_voga.projects.docs` demo project because it has no
real-world usage, and because it is already enough work to get the two
others (edmund and roger) documented correctly.

I fixed a bug in :func:`lino.api.doctest.show_fields`.
