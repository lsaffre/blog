=======================

Today I did nothing but adapting the test suites.  The test suites of
:ref:`cosi`, :ref:`welfare` and :ref:`voga` needed quite some changes
because the demo data has changed a lot. Now they pass again.

The documents :ref:`voga.specs.invoicing` and :ref:`voga.specs.trading`
now contain more meaningful tests. Though I am far from being
satisfied.

I renamed the ``demo_bookings`` fixture of :mod:`lino_xl.lib.finan`
to :mod:`payments <lino_xl.lib.finan.fixtures.payments>`, and
replaced all occurences of ``demo_bookings`` in :attr:`demo_fixtures
<lino.core.site.Site.demo_fixtures>` by ``demo_bookings
payments``. This was needed because otherwise the payments fixture was
run before the fixtures that generated the causes for these payments.

Now that we have a separate fixture for payments, I can rename the
fixture which creates automatic invoices back from :mod:`demo2` to
:mod:`demo_bookings`.

I removed the :mod:`lino_voga.projects.docs` demo project because it
has no real-world usage, and because it is already enough work to get
the two others (edmund and roger) documented correctly.

I fixed a bug in :func:`lino.api.doctest.show_fields`.
