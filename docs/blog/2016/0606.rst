For :mod:`lino_voga.projects.voga2` they asked to have most of their
custom fields already in the `insert_layout`. No problem.

Printing a payment reminder for par partner: I wrote a new
:xfile:`payment_reminder.weasy.html` template, and the the appy.pod
template :xfile:`payment_reminder.body.html` is currently not used.  I
also added `excerpts.ExcerptsByOwner` to the "More" tab of the partner
detail (of :ref:`voga`).
