=======================

A first little change for :ticket:`862`: When updating the events of a
course, Lino (in
:meth:`update_auto_events<lino.modlib.cal.mixins.EventGenerator.update_auto_events>`)
now reports conflicting events to the JS console.  Actually the
detailed report should be visible without opening the JS console, and
mentioned conflicting events should be clickable. Per calendar event
there should be a link with a list of all events on that day.

More optimizations for :ref:`voga`: New command "Create invoices" in
the main menu starts a "general" invoicing plan.

Note :ticket:`864`. Lino does not yet support model extension on more
than 2 generations of plugins.  Only known example so far is
`courses.Enrolment`. The coures plugin is defined three times:
:mod:`lino_cosi.lib.courses`, :mod:`lino_voga.lib.courses` and
:mod:`lino_voga.projects.roger.lib.courses`. We currently need a hack
to get it work: We must include 'Enrolment' in the
:attr:`extends_models <lino.core.plugin.Plugin.extends_models>` of
`roger` despite the fact that this model is *not* being extended
there. The `Enrolment` model definition in
:mod:`lino_voga.lib.courses` has a hard-coded ``abtract = False``.
