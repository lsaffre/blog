I worked on :ticket:`718`.

One noteworthy problem was this message in the Apache error log::

  AH01630: client denied by server configuration: /home/user/.../mysite/apache/wsgi.py

That was because mylino.net runs Apache 2.4 which has changed concepts
about security on the default config. I must specify permissions
explicitly::

    <Directory /home/user/mypy/mysite/apache>
        <Files wsgi.py>
            Require all granted
        </Files>
    </Directory>
