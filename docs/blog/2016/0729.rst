:ref:`grigorij` continues to walk through the tutorials and reports
his questions. Thanks for your patience, Grigorij!  Yesterday I
updated :ref:`lino.tutorial.tables`, today I worked on
:ref:`lino.tutorial.polls`. For example they restructured the Django
tutorial, so now we must read the *two* first chapters.

The project created in :ref:`lino.tutorial.hello` is no longer called
"mysite" but "hello". To avoid a name clash when we later instruct
them to follow Django's Polls tutorial.

Code change:

- I added a `warning filter
  <https://docs.python.org/2/library/warnings.html#warning-filter>`__
  to :manage:`initdb` and :manage:`initdb_demo` to suppress the
  warnings about empty fixtures. (See also :djangoticket:`18213`).

- New site attribute :attr:`history_aware_logging
  <lino.core.site.Site.history_aware_logging>`.
