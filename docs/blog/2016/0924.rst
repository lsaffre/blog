Congratulations to :ref:`subha` who made his first contribution to the
Lino project (for :ticket:`1174`, his work is visible in `noi/pull/4
<https://github.com/lino-framework/noi/pull/4/>`_).

I fixed a problem in :mod:`lino.modlib.export_excel`: I removed a
keyword `guess_types=True` because it caused trouble in openpyxl 3.4.0
and because I don't know whether it is needed.



The `release notes
<http://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/default/changes.html>`__ also
explain that `ws.rows` and `ws.columns` now always return generators
and start at the top of the worksheet. I adapted
:ref:`lino.specs.export_excel` to this.
