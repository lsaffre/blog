The :class:`PendingCourseRequests

in :ref:`welfare` was broken after yesterday's changes (:ticket:`849`).

Printing a sales invoice
========================

Some days ago I decided to switch back from wkhtmltopdf to appypod for
printing invoices. That was because I realized that wkhtmltopdf is not
yet able to render custome headers and footers.

Now I realized that appypod is not yet able to render complex HTML
chunks inside tables.  (Actually I knew it, but had swept it under the
carpet) Especially the `description` field of a sales invoice item in
:ref:`voga` can contain quite complex HTML.  But here it is myself
who's guilty. So it's more easy to change ;-) I worked on it, and the
invoices are now at least readable.
