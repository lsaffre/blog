About bleach and html5lib
=========================

I noticed that bleach (see :mod:`lino.mixin.bleached`) requires
html5lib version `0.9999999` (7*"9") while the current version of
html5lib is `0.999999999` (9*"9").

Which means that you might inadvertedly break bleach when you ask to
update html5lib::

    $ pip install -U html5lib
    ...
    Successfully installed html5lib-0.999999999
    $ python -m bleach
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/runpy.py", line 163, in _run_module_as_main
        mod_name, _Error)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/runpy.py", line 111, in _get_module_details
        __import__(mod_name)  # Do not catch exceptions initializing package
      File "/site-packages/bleach/__init__.py", line 14, in <module>
        from html5lib.sanitizer import HTMLSanitizer
    ImportError: No module named sanitizer

Or you might inadvertedly downgrade html5lib when you ask to
update bleach::

    $ pip install -U bleach
    ...
    Successfully installed html5lib-0.9999999

I changed :mod:`lino.mixins.bleached` to be more severe: until now it
silently became inactive when bleach was not installed or broken.

Documentation
=============

- I integrated first suggestions by :ref:`rauno` 
  for :ticket:`40`.

- I started a presentation which I plan to use for several
  presentations during the coming weeks.  `The Lino framework
  <../../dl/talk/lino.html>`__
  
  Made using `landslide`. I also tried `hieroglyph` and would have
  enjoyed to have it integrated into my blog (including reflinks for
  example), but didn't get it there.
