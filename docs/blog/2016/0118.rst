========================

I adapted the Lino test suite to my changes for :ticket:`692` which I
committed this weekend.  In :mod:`lino_book.projects.pisa` the path of
the template has changed.

I added a :xfile:`tasks.py` file for Lino and for :ref:`welfare`.

I started to code the `HoursByDossier` table (:ticket:`584`).
