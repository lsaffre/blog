Upgrade to ExtJS 6
==================

Good news: after the ComboBox conversion, Hamza is now advancing
quickly in :ticket:`37` (Upgrade to ExtJS 6), fixing problem in rows.
BTW he also wrote a first `blog entry
<http://hamza.lino-framework.org/migration-from-extjs3-to-extjs6.html#migration-from-extjs3-to-extjs6>`_
about his work.

Now it would be really cool to get :ref:`noi` with ExtJS 6 into a
usable state. We would start to use it ourselves before releasing it
to some customer! This is what I actually want with ticket
:ticket:`896`.  

I tried by adding the following line to the :class:`Site` definition
in my local copy of :mod:`lino_noi.projects.team.settings.demo`::

    default_ui = 'lino_extjs6.extjs'

and then doing::

    $ cd lino_noi/projects/team
    $ python manage.py runserver

This first attempt revealed (as I expected) that
:mod:`lino.modlib.tinymce` causes problems.  In a first step I plan to
just remove this plugin and to try whether the built-in text editor of
ExtJS 6 is better than that of ExtJS 3.  So we just deactivate TinyMCE
by adding some more lines to above file ::


    def get_apps_modifiers(self, **kw):
        kw = super(Site, self).get_apps_modifiers(**kw)
        kw.update(tinymce=None)
        return kw

But even then I still have a JavaScript syntax error "Unterminated
string literal" in the following line::

    var AttachmentsByMail_htmlbox333 = Ext.create(
        'Lino.HtmlBoxPanel', { 
            "always_enabled": true,
            "bodyStyle": "overflow-x:hidden;", "containing_panel": this,
            "flex": 22, 
            "items": Ext.create('Ext.BoxComponent,{ autoScroll:true}), 
            "layout": "fit",
            "listeners": { 
                "render": Lino.quicktip_renderer("Pi\u00e8ces jointes",
                "(outbox.Mails.AttachmentsByMail) ") }, 
            "master_panel": this, 
            "name": "AttachmentsByMail", 
            "title": "Pi\u00e8ces jointes",
            "tools": [ Lino.show_in_own_window_button(Lino.outbox.AttachmentsByMail.grid) ], 
            "value": "<br/>" });

Hamza, can you try to reproduce and fix this? 


Lino Voga final sprint
======================

For :ticket:`903` I worked out my next suggestion for the
:meth:`__str__` method of a :class:`Course
<lino_voga.projects.roger.lib.courses.models.Course>` (in Lino Voga Ã 
la Roger).

Added a new model :class:`lino_xl.lib.sales.models.PaperType`
(:ticket:`902`).
