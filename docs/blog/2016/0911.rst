Philippe Ombredanne answered to my question for :cmd:`inv
test_sdist`. His suggestion probably solves my problem, but I need to
integrate it before I can confirm. (In reality I have more than one
"A" project to delete from the download directory, and I don't like
his use of :cmd:`pip install --download` which is deprecated::

    DEPRECATION: pip install --download has been deprecated and will be
    removed in the future. Pip now has a download command that should be
    used instead.

Maybe I don't need to delete my dependencies from the download
directory if I specify the ``-f`` in different order?

And if I use the ``download`` command instead of ``install
--download``, where is the download directory? My :file:`~/.pypirc`
file currently doesn't contain anything related. Is there adefault
location?
