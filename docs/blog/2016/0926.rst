Oops, I did :ticket:`1187` (Set default priority for new tickets to
100 instead of 0) myself instead of delegating it to
:ref:`subha`. Subha, please look at the two commits
https://github.com/lino-framework/noi/commits/master
and let me know whether you understand what I did.

Oops, and only afterwards I realized that this would have been an
occasion for me to try a pull request instead of boldly committing my
changes without asking anybody's opinion...
