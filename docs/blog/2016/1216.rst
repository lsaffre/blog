I fixed a bug which I introduced on :doc:`1123` and which caused the
insert window to be read-only in certain cases. More precisely the
insert window of tables which had no separate `insert_layout`,
i.e. which use their `detail_layout` for both detail window and insert
window.

The bug was in :mod:`lino.modlib.extjs.ext_renderer`::

    if dh.layout._formpanel_name.endswith('.InsertFormPanel'):
        yield "  default_record_id: -99999,"


This test was in :meth:`js_render_FormPanelSubclass`, which was one
step too early. It is now in :meth:`js_render_detail_action_FormPanel`
where it looks at the action, and not at the name of the panel::

    if isinstance(action.action, InsertRow):
        yield "  default_record_id: -99999,"
