=======================

I continued on :ticket:`1089` and found the explanation. The new
:term:`appy.pod` seems more strict about whitespace in ``for ``
statements.

The real error message (which I saw after rendering the document with
`raiseOnError=False` was:
  
   Bad "for" expression "row in". A "for" expression must be of the
   form: {name} in {expression}. {name} must be a Python variable
   name. It is the name of the iteration variable. {expression} is a
   Python expression that, when evaluated, produces a Python sequence
   (tuple, string, list, etc).

The template used to render ISIP contracts contained the
following statement at three places::

  do text for p in self.contractpartner_set.all()

The problem disappeared after I had gone through all three statements,
deleted the whitespace between "p" and "in", and inserted a new space.
Don't ask me what was wrong with the previous whitespace. There was no
visible difference. I was (h)appy that it worked and didn't want to
investigate the `content.xml`.

Inline strong start-string without end-string
=============================================

Yet another problem caused indirectly by the Ubuntu upgrade: I cannot
build the docs for atelier (without setting `tolerate_sphinx_warnings`
to `True`)::

  atelier/atelier/tasks.py:docstring of atelier.tasks:0: WARNING: Inline strong start-string without end-string.

This is actually an old problem. It comes because autosummary includes
imported objects (and because some external code may contain invalid
docstrings). See `Sphinx ticket #1061
<https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/1061>`__.  I manualy
patched my copy of Sphinx as explained `there
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25405110/sphinx-autosummary-with-toctree-also-lists-imported-members/25460763#25460763>`__.
