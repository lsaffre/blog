=========================

I removed the :mod:`lino.modlib.vocbook` package from the Lino
repository because it is really a very special thing and had not much
to do with Lino. I used it to generate a French course for
Estonians. Maybe I'll publish it some day as a separate project.


I changed the symbol used to represent :class:`EndSession
<lino_noi.lib.clocking.actions.EndSession>` from ◉ to ■.

I discovered the `Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs
<http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/block/miscellaneous_symbols_and_pictographs/list.htm>`__
block and --as if I had nothing urgent to do-- selected some of them
as :attr:`button_text <lino.core.workflows.State.button_text>` for our
:class:`TicketStates <lino_noi.lib.tickets.choicelists.TicketStates>`::

Advantage for everyday users is that the content of the `Workflow`
field becomes shorter.  Disadvantage for newbies is that they must
learn the meaning of symbols...


pytest: command not found
=========================

Travis reported :message:`/bin/bash: pytest: command not found` when
building :ref:`noi`. Yes of course: the `pytest` dependency must be in
`install_requires` and not in `tests_require` because we are not
launching :cmd:`setup.py test` in that case.
