Notification framework
======================

This morning I believed that ticket :ticket:`1079` should be solved
now, and so I did a relase in :ref:`welcht`. But nope, it seems that
it is not solved. The rest of my workday went into finding bugs
and writing test cases for the notification framework, partly
with some more changes to the API.

It was intensive work which required long-term concentration, but now
Lino Welfare also has a new tested document
:ref:`welfare.specs.notify`, and the automatic tests in
:mod:`lino_welfare.projects.std.tests.test_notify` are now more or
less complete.  It was really time to write these test cases!

I removed the :meth:`get_actors_module` method and instead, at
startup, set default values for :attr:`rt.actors
<lino.core.site.Site.actors>` from :attr:`rt.models`.

During the release I also stumbled over the following problem which
took me at least two hours.


Configuring the logger for schedule
===================================

In :ref:`welcht` they are currently having a big Lino log file which
is filled with lines as the following::

  201607-24 13:02:44 INFO __init__ : Running job Every 10 seconds do send_pending_emails() (last run: 2016-07-24 13:02:34, next run: 2016-07-24 13:02:44)

The `schedule` module is clear and simple, it does this::

    import logging
    logger = logging.getLogger('schedule')

    class Job(object):

        def run(self):
            """Run the job and immediately reschedule it."""
            logger.info('Running job %s', self)
            ret = self.job_func()
            self.last_run = datetime.datetime.now()
            self._schedule_next_run()
            return ret

So indeed we must set the schedule logger level to WARNING.
:meth:`lino.core.site.Site.setup_logging` does this now.  I did a lot
of Lino commits because the change "somehow didn't work", and I
thought that the problem had to do with the logger configuration.

The actual guilty was supervisor: for some reason (I guess because I
had changed several times the actual name of the :manage:`linod`
process to start) there were a dozen of :manage:`linod` processes
running, and of course these processes continued to to their work
trustfully...

TIL: when you change the configuration of supervisor, make sure that
any old processes have been stopped!
