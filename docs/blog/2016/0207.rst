Ticket :ticket:`770`. The :func:`checkout_guest
<lino.modlib.reception.models.checkout_guest>` function now verifies
that `gone_since` is empty. If not, Lino should assume that the
function has been called by accident and return without overwriting
that value.  It now also calls :meth:`full_clean` before saving the
modified Guest and/or Event.


MySessionsByDate now shows the project of the ticket
