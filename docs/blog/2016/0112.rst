I got a nice message from Monit::

    Resource limit matched Service datafs 

            Date:        Tue, 12 Jan 2016 06:58:38
            Action:      alert
            Host:        myvps.example.com
            Description: space usage 80.8% matches resource limit [space usage>80.0%]

    Your faithful employee,
    Monit

Do I need to upgrade my server space? Not yet. I just need to tidy up.
I started a new "cheat sheet" document :ref:`admin.du`.
