==========================
The first Vigala Code Camp
==========================

Saturday, October 15, 2016.  Today was the first `Vigala Code Camp
<http://www.saffre-rumma.net/vcc/>`_, a part of the `EU Code Week
<http://codeweek.eu/>`_ initiative.

The event had been announced on `their website
<http://events.codeweek.eu/view/13421/vigala-code-camp-october-2016/>`__,
but otherwise I had not made any publicity.  I like to start gently.

So this first edition was small, it lasted only one day, there were
only two participants and only one speaker (namely me).

But we worked efficitently, it was a good experience and maybe the
beginning of a great new tradition.  JÃ¼ri promised that he and the
Vana-Vigala professional school will help with future camps.

This camp was for intermediate level developers with at least some
`Python <https://www.python.org/>`__ experience. We learned how to
write database applications using Lino. As a preparation the
participants had followed the first two sections of the `Developer's
Guide'i <http://www.lino-framework.org/dev/index.html>`__ ("Getting
started" and "Your first application").

Vigala Code Camps are free for the participants, but you need your own
laptop computer with Python already installed.  I do this as a
volunteer and in the hope of finding new helpers for Lino.
