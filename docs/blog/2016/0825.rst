Lino Care moving forward
========================

Yesterday I had a meeting with Johannes, and now I worked on
:ticket:`1128` (Miscellaneous optimizations for :ref:`care`). Today is
a meeting with Annalisa, Lukas and Carl.

:func:`lino.modlib.notify.models.clean_seen_notifications` now also
deletes unseen notifications (if they are older than 24 hours).

:class:`lino.modlib.notify.models.MyNotifications.get_welcome_messages`
was emitting its message also to users who cannot see this table
(because they don't satisfy `required_roles`).

New field `Users.callme_mode` and new table `OtherUsers`. This is
because they want normal users to be able to see some information
(phone, gsm, remarks, ...)


I fixed a bug in :mod:`lino.modlib.extjs` which caused row actions to
not get disabled in a detail form with `hide_top_toolbar` set to
`True`. In :ref:`extjs6` that bug didn't exist.


I changed the `button_text` of :class:`AssignToMe
<lino.modlib.users.mixins.AssignToMe>` from [☝] to [✋].
