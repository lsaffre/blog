Sigh! You just wanted to dive into your work, and then there's a
message in your inbox which changes all your good plans...

Configuring Postfix relay
=========================

Today I discovered that messages to info@lino-framework.org don't get
their way to my inbox. The sender then gets a message like this::

    This is the mail system at host lino-framework.org.

    I'm sorry to have to inform you that your message could not
    be delivered to one or more recipients. It's attached below.

    For further assistance, please send mail to postmaster.

    If you do so, please include this problem report. You can
    delete your own text from the attached returned message.

                       The mail system

    <john.doe@gmx.net> (expanded from <luc@lino-framework.org>): 
    host smtp.uninet.ee[194.150.66.204] said: 
      550 5.7.1 <john.doe@gmx.net>: 
        Sender address rejected: 
        Message rejected due to: SPF fail - not authorized.
        Please see
        http://www.openspf.org/Why?s=mfrom;id=john.doe@gmx.net;ip=123.456.78.90;r=
        (in reply to MAIL FROM command)


I am almost *glad* that this error occurs because it seems to indicate
a bug in my Postfix configuration which might be the cause for
problems with some mailing list members who don't receive list mails.

The error message gives a hint:

    If you run your own MTA, you may have to set a "smarthost" or
    "relayhost". If you are mailing from outside your ISP's network, you
    may also have to make your MTA use authenticated SMTP. Ideally your
    server should listen on port 587 as well as port 25.

I have almost no experience with `Postfix Configuration
<http://www.postfix.org/BASIC_CONFIGURATION_README.html>`_, so I'd
rather hope to continue on this with some friend.

Suggestions for disbursement instructions
=========================================

I fixed another problem discovered already 2 months ago with Wilfried
(but the problem with these problems is to make them reproduceable):

The :class:`SuggestionsByPaymentOrderItem
<lino_xl.lib.finan.models.SuggestionsByPaymentOrderItem>` table did
not show the clients (i.e. actually the `project` of the
movements). Now this table has a multiline column "Info".
