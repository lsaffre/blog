I worked on :ticket:`1113` and understood that we need a new type of
computation for hours which I call :class:`GuestHoursEvent`.
And maybe :class:`GuestHours` will never be used.

New table :class:`lino_xl.lib.cal.ui.MyUnconfirmedAppointments`
(:ticket:`1279`).

And :ticket:`1259` can be considered ready (Ã  confirmer).

Except that I changed the label of `workflow_buttons` from "Workflow"
to "Actions" (a spontaneous optimization, and I seem to like it) but
it caused quite some test case failures and did not yet adapt them.
