Sandeep found a solution for #463
=================================

Congratulations and thanks to Sandeep who found a working solution for
:ticket:`463`.  Sandeep is a voluntary contributor who does this "just
for fun" after his daywork as Python developper in a bank. Despite
this he found a solution to a problem where I was rather stuck.
Thanks also to Hamza who tested and merged Sandeep's work into his
repository and wrote a `pull request
<https://github.com/lsaffre/atelier/pull/14>`__.  This is an
encouraging piece of news because it shows that Lino starts to "live"
also without me.

It is the first time that I saw a (realistic) coverage report for
:mod:`atelier`::

    $ inv cov
    Running tests for 'atelier' within coverage...

Of course 18% is nothing to be proud about, that was not part of the
ticket. The important thing is that now we can see this number and
take it as a motivation to work on this.


Thinking in Python
==================

An example of how it is possible to *think* in Python.

I am working on :ticket:`143`, more precisely importing legacy data.
I am analyzing the list of their journals.  I exported their table of
journals from TIM to a csv file. From this file I now generated a
:cmd:`pm run` script which will create these journals on their Lino
server.

.. literalinclude:: 0305.py

Above script is just the final result. It evolved during the weekend
because I had to understand which journals should be imported and how
to convert them from TIM to Lino.

How I used it::

  $ python 0305.py > create_journals.py
  $ scp create_journals.py luc@their.server:~
