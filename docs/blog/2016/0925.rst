Some ForeignKeys not being protected
====================================

I discovered and fixed :ticket:`1183`, a subtle problem which might
cause unexpected data loss. Changes in :ref:`lino` (the bug itself)
and :ref:`noi`, :ref:`book`, :ref:`voga` (test suites).

The problem was a bug in
:meth:`lino.core.ddh.DisableDeleteHandler.add_fk` : if a model had
more than one pointers to a given other model. only the first FK was
being collected, the others being ignored. As a consequence, these
other pointers did *not* replace Django's default behaviour (cascaded
delete) by Lino's default behaviour (protected).

One symptom was that `tickets.Ticket.reporter` was not listed below in
the output of analyzer.show_foreign_keys(). The following snippets
helped to find out why:


>>> for (model, fk) in rt.models.users.User._lino_ddh.fklist:
...     print(fk)
changes.Change.user
clocking.ServiceReport.user
clocking.Session.user
comments.Comment.user
excerpts.Excerpt.user
faculties.Competence.user
notify.Notification.user
outbox.Mail.user
stars.Star.user
tickets.Project.assign_to
tickets.Ticket.assigned_to
tinymce.TextFieldTemplate.user
uploads.Upload.user
users.Authority.user

>>> for f in rt.models.tickets.Ticket._meta.get_fields():
...     if f.name == 'reporter':
...         print(repr(f))
<django.db.models.fields.related.ForeignKey: reporter>

In order to evaluate the urgence of upgrading for :ref:`welfare`, here
is a list of the most important `disable_delete_handlers` which were
not being installed :

- users.User : aids.Granting.signer, aids.IncomeConfirmation.signer,
  aids.RefundConfirmation.signer, aids.SimpleConfirmation.signer,
  art61.Contract.user_asd, cal.Event.assigned_to,
  immersion.Contract.user_asd, isip.Contract.user_asd,
  jobs.Contract.user_asd, users.Authority.authorized

- countries.Place : addresses.Address.region contacts.Partner.region

- countries.Country : pcsw.Client.birth_country

- contacts.Person: aids.RefundConfirmation.doctor,
  art61.Contract.contact_person, art61.Contract.signer2

Which means that with versions older than today it is recommended to
be careful when deleting users, places, countries, persons and
companies. Because if no database object points to a user via the
"first" FK, then Lino would silently delete database objects which
point to that user, place, person or company using another FK.
