About Lino Hosting
==================

I worked on the documentation in the :ref:`lino.hosters`.  After quite
some experiments (IMIO since 2012, Code Gears since 2015) I hope that
thing are now getting clear and that Abakus will become the first Lino
Hosting Provider.

Python 3 support for :term:`appy.pod` must wait
===============================================

I changed :ticket:`1157` into *Sleeping* state. The situation is a bit
complex on the human level.  My current opinion is:

- There is no need to hurry because we can use `Stefan Klug's Python 3
  port <https://libraries.io/github/stefanklug/appypod>`_ which seems
  to work at least for the test suite.

- Gaetan is still stuck with Python 2.4 and not yet actively
  interested neither in porting Appy to Python 3 nor in collaborating
  with contributors. This might change in the future.

- `Sandro <https://github.com/sandroden>`_ made good suggestions to
  Gaetan in a private dialog, and Gaetan did not yet answer all
  questions.  I hope that they find an agreement in the future before
  a solution becomes necessary.

- The whole question of hosting Lino under Python 3 is just a
  psychologic feature as long as Python 2 is officially supported.

Thanks to Gaetan, Sandro and Stefan for their work so far.

I realized that :term:`ODFPy` is required only for :ref:`xl`, not for
the Lino core.
