:ticket:`932` (Make the comments system in Noi usable) is to get Lino
Noi into a state where we can actually use it for discussing about
Lino related topics, including email and instant messaging.  It will
probably require a new feature of popup notification like Facebook and
Hangouts have.

This ticket partly revokes my previous statement that Lino Noi "does
not want to replace" existing email and messaging applications. In the
beginning I believed that it is possible to just "integrate" these
applications. Meanwhile I believe that integrating is even more utopic
than replacing them.

While :ticket:`932` is for "internal" use and less urgent, we have the
following customer tickets:

- :ticket:`930` (Send notification when a guest checks in)
- :ticket:`923` (Display live notifications even when the browser is
  minimized)

Especially :ticket:`923` is tricky.  When :ref:`gx` and I started to
talk about this, I suggested that Lino just sends notifications *via
e-mail* and the social agents just need an e-mail client which
displays notifications when new mails arrive.

Unfortunately it seems that this is not possible (Gerd tried already
several times to explain me why, but I still didn't understand).

Do we accecpt :ticket:`923`? We might refuse it with the explanation
that we are not going to write a better Facebook.

If we accept it, what would this mean? I see at least two new things
to learn:

- Make Lino event-driven using Django-Channels (see e.g. `Quick
  introduction to Django Channels
  <http://www.machinalis.com/blog/introduction-to-django-channels/>`_)

- Choose a protocol for instant messaging (see e.g. `Comparison of
  instant messaging protocols
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_instant_messaging_protocols>`_)
