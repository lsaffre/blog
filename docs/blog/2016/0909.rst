The badges
==========

I changed the markup for showing the "badges" in the
:xfile:`setup_info.py` files of :ref:`lino`, :ref:`xl` and
:ref:`book`.

Instead of defining a lot of ``.. image::`` directives, I use a single
``.. raw:: html`` directive. This is mainly to avoid warnings when
building the doc tree (so that I can set
:attr:`inv.tolerate_sphinx_warnings` back to `False`). Another benefit
is that the code gets less complex because we define everything in one
place and don't need to invent additional unique names.
       

Last optimizations for :ref:`care`
==================================

Today I finished the list of optimizations after my last meeting with
:ref:`annalisa` for :ticket:`1128` (at least those which I should
implement ASAP).


        
Deploy to :ref:`lf`
===================

16.16 (GMT+2) : I did an upgrade on :ref:`lf`. Sorry if you had slow
response times.


Newbie documentation
====================


The :cmd:`inv test_sdist` command
=================================

The :cmd:`inv test_sdist` command is failing in :ref:`noi`.  The
problem is that I don't know how to explain to pip what I want:

- for all *my* projects, install the version at :attr:`inv.sdist_dir`
- for all external projects, use PyPI

I tried with::  
  
  $ pip install -f SDIST_DIR lino-noi

which ``lino-noi`` from SDIST_DIR, but ``lino`` and ``lino-xl`` are
installed from PyPI despite the fact that there is also an archive
file for them in SDIST_DIR.

I tried with::
  
  $ pip install --no-index -f SDIST_DIR --extra-index-url https://pypi.python.org/simple lino-noi

which fails because it never looks up PyPI, even external packages::

    Collecting lino-noi
    Collecting lino-xl (from lino-noi)
    Collecting appy (from lino-xl->lino-noi)
      Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement appy (from lino-xl->lino-noi) (from versions: )
    No matching distribution found for appy (from lino-xl->lino-noi)

What else can I try?!

I asked this on https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3959
