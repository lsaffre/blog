=======================================


Updated :doc:`/changes`.

:func:`lino.ui.views.requested_actor` no longer causes an internal 
server error when a request with an invalid app_label arrives.
And it now raises a http.Http404 instead 
of a simple Exception for any invalid request. 

This was because some robot had started to consult regularily 
some pages 
http://belref.lino-framework.org/plain/countries/Cities?ul=nl
(which should be 
http://belref.lino-framework.org/countries/Cities?ul=nl).
Instead of answering with a 500, Lino now answers with a 404.

Also translated the messages appearing on this page to the three 
languages of my home country.

The beforementioned page on belref showed also Aalst, for which I 
happened to know that it is Alost in French.
Reason for me to read more about 
`Aalst <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aalst,_Belgium>`_
and to update the fixtures of :mod:`lino.modlib.countries` 
so the belref shows it correctly.

Moved `lino_welfare.modlib.statbel` to `lino.modlib.statbel`
because belref depends on it.
