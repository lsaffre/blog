EIDReader applet
----------------

Continued on my `EIDReader` applet.
Started a documentation page :ref:`eidreader`.

It should now display more 
or less all the identity & address information
for both Estonian and Belgian eID cards.
Except for Belgian ones where it currently throws a 
`ClassNotFoundException`.
Before I can continue on this I need to learn more about 
`Deploying an Applet
<http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/applet/deployingApplet.html>`_
and 
`Deployment In-Depth
<http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/deploymentInDepth/index.html>`_.

I downloaded a file `eid-applet-sdk-1.1.0.RC3.zip
<https://code.google.com/p/eid-applet/downloads/detail?name=eid-applet-sdk-1.1.0.RC3.zip&can=2&q=>`_
and extracted a file :file:`eid-applet-service-1.0.1.GA.jar` 
from it 
and added it to my local classpath
(see :srcref:`/java/Makefile`).
It compiles and jars without error message.
But the applet, 
when I launch it via
:srcref:`eid_test.html </lino/media/applets/eid_test.html>`
then throws a `ClassNotFoundException`.
Which is understandable since the applet cannot know 
how to find the :file:`eid-applet-service-1.0.1.GA.jar` file.
And I don't know how to tell it where it is...

I think that it would be more fun to do this together 
with somebody else.
Maybe some Java developer in Estonia has mercy and 
helps me to get this running?



Can I use the "external text" icon from  Wikipedia?
---------------------------------------------------

I changed the "Show this panel in own window" of the welcome screen 
(the one displayed behind every "main item header",
see :meth:`lino.ui.Site.get_admin_main_items`
and
:srcref:`/lino/config/admin_main_base.html`)
from `application_view_columns.png` to the |lnk|
icon used in Wikipedia to designate external links.
Because it looks better and is more intuitive.

.. |lnk| image:: external_text.png
  :target: _images/external_text.png

Here is is once again in big:

.. image:: external_text.png
  :height: 100px
  :width: 100px
  :target: _images/external_text.png

So I am redistributing together with Lino an icon from Wikipedia.
**Is this allowed?**
I scanned their `Terms of Use 
<http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use#7._Licensing_of_Content>`_
and as far as I understand them there is no problem 
as long as Lino is distributed under the GPL.
Please let me know if you see a danger that I am committing a criminal 
act out of ignorance.
