========

- New implementation for 
  :func:`dtos <djangosite.dbutils.dtos>` 
  and
  :func:`dtosl <djangosite.dbutils.dtosl>` 
  using Django's :setting:`FORMAT_MODULE_PATH` setting.
  
- Some implementation changes in :mod:`north.babel`. 
  It is no longer necessar to reduce Django's :setting:`LANGUAGES` setting
  to the babel languages.
  Bug danger. 

- Moved the 
  :attr:`languages <djangosite.Site.languages>` 
  attribute from :mod:`north`   to :mod:`djangosite`.

- Updated :doc:`/tutorials/quickstart` for Harsh.


- Fixed a user traceback "global name 'dd' is not defined".
  Wrote a doctest article to test this:
  :doc:`/tutorials/auto_create/index`
  
- Fixed a user traceback "NameError at /api/debts/ExpensesByBudget/920: 
  global name 'rpt' is not defined".
  
- Getting the doctest suite to pass for Lino is quite 
  some work.
  
- Oops, it was naive to believe that 
  :meth:`update_settings 
  <djangosite.utils.doctest.DjangoDocTester.update_settings`
  is possible.
  It works only in certain limited cases. 
  For example most modlib apps cannot get re-imported.

- Started to use `sphinx-apidoc
  <http://sphinx-doc.org/invocation.html#invocation-of-sphinx-apidoc>`__
  and sphinx-build's `-W` option ("consider warnings as errors").
  This turned out to be more expensive than expected because 
  it caused a lot of tidy-up work.
