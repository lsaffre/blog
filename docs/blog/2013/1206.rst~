===================================

The public demos for :ref:`polly` and 
:ref:`logos` were broken due to a server 
configuration problem.
And I didn't notice it because they were not listed in :ref:`demos`.

The conversion of existing: renderers to plugins
will be an occasion to tidy up some historic ambiguities.

- The Kernel. 
  The object stored in `settings.SITE.ui` : is (like SITE itself) 
  a "de facto singleton". But it remains 
  an independent class/object instance 
  (and is not merged into the Site)
  because it gets created and imported only when the modules are 
  populated. Might rename it to `kernel`. 

  Until now the activities and methods of the kernel were 
  scattered across
  `ui.base`, `ui.ui` and `core.kernel`. 
  Now they are all in one place.

TODO:

- The three renderers (TextRenderer, PlainRenderer and ExtRenderer) 
  become subclasses of `ad.App` and are no longer available
  as `SITE.plain_renderer` etc but using `SITE.plugins`::

    SITE.plain_renderer -> SITE.plugins.plain
    SITE.ext_renderer -> SITE.plugins.extjs
    SITE.text_renderer -> SITE.plugins.text

  (TODO: so we get 3 new "system app_labels": "plain", "extjs" 
  and "text". This is a limit of Django's app_label system: you 
  cannot define custom namespaces)

  `SITE.default_renderer`
