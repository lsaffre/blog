===================================

The plain html renderer now renders a newline character (``\n``) in a column header 
(i.e. in the `verbose_name` of a field) as a ``br`` tag.

:ref:`welfare` : 
when showing selection list of Partners, Households and Organisations, 
Lino now adds the Partner no. and an ``*`` if partner is marked as 
obsolete (as it did until now only for Clients but not for Partners).

:mod:`lino.modlib.contacts` : `Company.__unicode__` now also 
includes the optional content of the `prefix` field.

CitiesByCountry  : The title was "Places **of** <country>",
(the default title generated for a slave table request)
now it is "Places **in** <country>".
Added new class attribute 
:attr:`lino.core.dbtables.Table.details_of_master_template'
which is useful for this kind of situation.

Worked on the web interface of belref:

- slave grids showed all rows instead of only 15
- slave grids now have a title, and clicking this title opens the table in its own window
- language selector links didn't work in certain situations
- having plain_prefix empty, admin_prefix nonempty and use_extjs=True

TODO: 

- one testcase fails
- upgrade to bootstrap 3
- layout of detail
- repair lino.projects.cms
