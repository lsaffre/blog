==================================

Continued on yesterday's "To-Do-Liste Sven" (:blogref:`20131017`).

- The `cal.Calendar` model is back. I had replaced it by a system of 
  subscriptions where each user could define application-specific 
  filter criteria per Subscription. This resulted in a system where it was 
  possible for an Event to appear in different Calendars.
  Which would have been nice, but the problem with that idea is 
  that `Ext.ensible.CalendarPanel` isn't designed for it, it wants 
  a list of calendars and each Event pointing to exactly one of them.
  
  So I return back to *almost* the old system
  (and that "almost" is what Lino has learned):
  `cal.Event` has no direct FK to Calendar, but a `get_calendar` method.
  And 
  :ref:`welfare` users see one Calendar per `User`
  while
  :ref:`faggio` users see one Calendar per `Room`.


- Updated the :ref:`welfare` test suite to several recent changes.

- New item "Once" in Recurrencies.

- insert_layout for `courses.Line`
- New field courses.Line every_unit (Recurrencies)



Split up :mod:`lino.modlib.cal.models` into more digestable chunks:
:mod:`models_task <lino.modlib.cal.models_task>`
:mod:`models_guest <lino.modlib.cal.models_guest>`
:mod:`models_event <lino.modlib.cal.models_event>`
:mod:`models_calendars <lino.modlib.cal.models_calendar>`

In a first checkin I had tried to turn
:mod:`lino.modlib.cal.models`
into a package containing the above files.
But that would require me to add an explicit `app_label
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/options/#app-label>`_
(the feature that app_label "is no longer required for models that are 
defined in a models package within an app" is only available in the 
development version).


I also did the mistake of naming them 
``task``,
``guest``,
``event`` and
``calendar`` in a first go.
And didn't notice that a module called 
`calendar <http://docs.python.org/2.7/library/calendar.html#module-calendar>`_
is part of the Python standard library.
The funny thing was that this bomb didn't explode in the Lino test suite, 
only in :ref:`welfare`::

An interesting example of a subtle pitfall!
