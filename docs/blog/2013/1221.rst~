Writing an extension for Firefox
--------------------------------

Does it make sense to implement :ref:`eidreader` 
as a browser extension (not as a Java applet)?

Before I can even decide whether this *question* makes sense, 
I should invest a few hours into how it would look like.

I discovered a cool tutorial for getting started: `Shortest Tutorial
for Firefox Extension/Toolbar Development!
<http://devilsworkshop.org/tips/shortest-tutorial-for-firefox-extensiontoolbar-development/347/>`_
written in 2007(!) by Rahul Bansai.  Cool! Got it running within one
hour!  Thanks to Rahul Bansai for this great entry point.
