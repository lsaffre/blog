======================================


Together with Manuel and Gerd we decided to give a last chance to
:ref:`eidreader`: try whether
the Oracle-Java-only problem is due to my self-certified signature.
Because anyway I'll have to buy a code signing certificate some day 
for :ref:`davlink`.

:class:`BeIdReaderPlugin <lino.mixins.beid.BeIdReaderPlugin>` now adds
a `permissions=sandbox` parameter in the hope that this will
remove the additional security warning. That's because in 
`Java Applet & Web Start - Code Signing
<http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/java-code-signing-1915323.html#5>`_ I read:

    Applets deployed using the older HTML tag approach (applet, embed or
    object tags in an html page) also should be signed.  Because the
    legacy practice was that signing applets indicated an intention to run
    with permissions, that will be the default behavior for signed
    html-tag-deployed applets. If you have an applet that is deployed in
    this way, and it does not require asking users for full permissions,
    add the following parameter to the tag: **<param name="permissions"
    value="sandbox" />**
