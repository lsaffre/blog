Django 1.7 will have plugins
----------------------------

I am glad to see that Django finally realizes something I have always
been preaching: they introduced the concept of `Applications
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/applications/>`_.  This
document even contains an official note about the confusing
terminology for "applications" in Django.
