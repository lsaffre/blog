Released Lino 1.5.5
-------------------

I released Lino :doc:`/releases/1.5.5` 
with one new feature, one bugfix,  
no change database 
and one manual task after upgrade.

This is the first time I release a Lino without releasing 
a Lino-Welfare at the same time.


Miscellaneous
-------------

- Continued research for :srcref:`docs/tickets/69`

- Fixed a bug introduced :doc:`0107`:
  'int' object has no attribute 'get_choices_text'

- Fixed an internal bug which caused 
  :attr:`lino.Lino.is_local_project_dir` to not be initialized correctly.

- :mod:`lino.utils.rstgen` now generates either a simple 
  or a complex table, depending on whether there's at least one 
  newline in some cell.
