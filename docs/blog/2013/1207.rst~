As another proof of concept for the new plugins concept 
using `ad.App`, I'd want to
convert the `use_extensible` setting into a plugin:

    Before:

    - :mod:`lino.modlib.cal`

    After:

    - :mod:`lino.apps.cal`
    - :mod:`lino.apps.extensible.cal`


More about app inheritance
--------------------------

One problem with app inheritance are the fixtures and the 
management commands.

Django discovers management commands by checking whether the app
module has a submodule "management" and then calling
:meth:`os.listdir` on that module's "commands" subdirectory.  (See
Django's `core/management/__init__.py` file)

I'll make a first attempt using symbolic links::

  lino/apps/extensible/cal/fixtures -> ../cal/fixtures/
  lino/apps/extensible/cal/management -> ../cal/management/
