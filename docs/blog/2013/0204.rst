- Yet another example that demonstrates why MTI is bad:
  :mod:`lino.test_apps.nomti`.


- Worked on the belgian VAT declaration in Lino Cos√¨.
  Moved it to the new module :mod:`lino.modlib.declarations`.
  Things start to become clear, but there's more to do.

- A small internal optimization: the code timestamp is now 
  computed only when the UI ist started, not already at 
  server startup.
  
  
This might be the last blog entry for about two weeks
because I travel to Belgium and there won't be much time 
for coding.
