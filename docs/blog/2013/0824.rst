===================================

The bug in my :mod:`html2xhtml <lino.utils.html2xhtml>`
(see :blogref:`20130821`)
was even more complex than what I was able to imagine that day.
For example the following HTML::

    <strong>
    <ul>
    <em><li>Foo</li></em>
    <li>Bar</li>
    </ul>
    </strong>
    
Should become::    

    <ul>
    <li><strong><em>Foo</em></strong></li>
    <li><strong>Bar</strong></li>
    </ul>


After trying to reinvent the wheel and realizing that it was getting 
sophisticated I discovered
`pytidylib <http://countergram.com/open-source/pytidylib>`_.
Voil√†, all problems solved!
My :mod:`html2xhtml <lino.utils.html2xhtml>` is now just a 
wrapper to 
`pytidylib <http://countergram.com/open-source/pytidylib>`_
(which itself is a wrapper to 
`HTML Tidy <http://tidy.sourceforge.net>`_).

Added new file :srcref:`/requirements.txt` which contains "pytidylib".

Install it either using `apt-get install python-tidylib`
or::

  $ sudo apt-get install libtidy-dev
  $ pip install pytidylib

Also updated the `requirements.txt` for :ref:`lino.welfare`
which is at 
https://code.google.com/p/lino-welfare/source/browse/requirements.txt
