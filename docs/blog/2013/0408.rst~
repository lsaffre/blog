More multilingual userdocs
---------------------------

Continued to fill the Lino-Welfare user manual,
:ref:`welfare.userdocs`,
my guinea pig for Lino's multilingual userdocs feature.

- A "Reference" part per module justs lists automatically generated 
  actor descriptions. But using a manual sort order and options about 
  how detailed to be.

- Where to put the definition of a actor? 
  (a model, a table, a choicelist) 
  The `help_text` of a model's standard table.
  
  The userdocs author should decide the order in which the different 
  concepts of an application should be presented to the user.
  
  The user doesn't need two entries distinct sections "Course" and "Courses", 
  (one for the model and the other for the default table).
  
I agree with what the Sphinx docs says: 
Using `ref <http://sphinx-doc.org/markup/inline.html#role-ref>`_ is 
advised over standard reStructuredText links to sections (like `Section title`_) 
because it works across files, when section headings are changed, and for 
all builders that support cross-references.  

But I didn't yet manage to have the ``.. actor::`` directive generate 
two ``:ref:`` entries that link to the *same* section title, 
one with the *singular* label and the other with the *plural* label.
I guess I need to understand `sphinx/domains/std.py` in order to find an answer.
Must add another
