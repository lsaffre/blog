===================================

Removed the default `SECRET_KEY` from :mod:`lino.projects.std.settings`,
this means that users must set this in 
their :xfile:`settings.py` or :xfile:`djangosite_local.py`.

Added a "Server status" field to :class:`lino.modlib.about.models.About` 
which currenty shows only one piece of information: 
the number of  pending threads (stored in :attr:`lino.ui.base.UI.pending_threads`).
Another useful piece of information would be number of currently active
users. But that's for later because there are more urgent things to do.

Discovered a subtle problem: caroline cannot open the detail of a 
cal.Event. This is because `ForeignKeyElement`
adds the same `onTrigger2Click` option 
(which calls `Lino.show_fk_detail`)
for everybody, but caroline has no view permission to see 
the global `cal.Events` table.
