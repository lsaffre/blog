Cool: Lino now has the concept of a "Report".
a Report is a longer document with a "story": 
a sequence of headings, free text and (that's what's new:) 
Tables.
One important fact is that Lino can render a Report 
as an ExtJS window or as a pdf document.
(the latter isn't yet fully functional, and my guinea pig report 
needs more end-user feedback, so i don't dare to publish 
screenshots)
