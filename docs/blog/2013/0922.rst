====================================


Added new models 
finan.JournalEntry (Op√©ration Diverse) and 
finan.PaymentOrder.

`Action.attach_to_actor` must now return `True` if the action 
is to be bound to that actor.
This new subtlety is used by 
the `register` and `deregister` actions of a Registrable
to make it possible that we declare ledger.Voucher as Registrable
despite the fact that a plain Voucher is not directly registrable,
only its children (Invoice, JournalEntry, BankStatement, 
PaymentOrder, Declaration...).
These actions return `False` to avoid being used on the 
plain Voucher model.
