Working on :ref:`faggio` : 
Endspurt vor der n√§chsten Besichtigung

Register no longer adds itself a RegisterAction and DeregisterAction.
That's because it was difficult to extend this workflow.
Also it was a lot of hackery to make these buttons run for all subclasses.
It is more transparent and less work to let application code write the 
workflow.

workflow_actions of a newly created record detail executed but 
did't refresh the screen because their "requesting panel" was 
the insert formpanel (and not the detail formpanel).

An EventGenerator now deletes all generated events before deleting herself.

Cool, if finally invested some time and found a better system for 
testing the database overview and the main menus per user profile:

See them in action for 
:ref:`Welfare <welfare.tested.general>`
and for 
:ref:`Faggio <faggio.tested.general>`.

I even started a new page of documentation about :doc:`/dev/testing`.

:ref:`atelier` : doctests are now being run with 
`+REPORT_ONLY_FIRST_FAILURE
<http://docs.python.org/2/library/doctest.html#doctest.REPORT_ONLY_FIRST_FAILURE>`_

And many more.

Checkin and updated the online demo sites (:ref:`demos`).
