Python fixtures and big databases
---------------------------------

Yesterday evening I saw for the first time that the process of 
the `initdb` command got killed by the OS
while loading a backup `b20130502_201829.py` that was 18 MB big::

    (dev)$ python manage.py initdb b20130502_201829
    ...
    We are going to flush your database (test_dsbe).
    Are you sure (y/n) ?y
    Creating tables ...
    ...
    INFO Loading /var/log/lino/backups/b20130502_201829.py...
    Killed
    (dev)$    

Note that this happens before any data is actually stored in the database.
Looks as if the mere compilation of the .py file requires so much memory 
that the OS decides to kill the process.

Yes, a :ref:`Python fixture <dpy>` 
needs to write the whole database content into a single file
(at least as long as we use it as a `Django serializer
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/serialization/>`_).
And of course when you import a Python source file with 
more than 18 MB of code text, then this will use some memory 
resources of your computer.

If I stop Apache and watch_tim and try the same command again, 
then it works.

Then I tried to reproduce this situation:

.. literalinclude:: 0502/a.py

Trying to run this script will of course exhaust memory after 
some time... but in a different way::

    153000000
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "0502.py", line 5, in <module>
        L.append(time.time())
    MemoryError

Then I found the `Process "Killed" 
<http://bytes.com/topic/python/answers/833603-process-killed>`__
thread asked by dieter in August 2008.
Where Eric Wertmann wrote:

  This is the behavior you'll see when your os has run out of some
  memory resource. The kernel sends a 9 signal. I'm pretty sure that
  if you exceed a soft limit your program will abort with out of memory
  error.
  
Conclusion:

The above problem was due to the server resources being exhausted, 
and was solved by a simple restart of some long-running processes.

If one day it appears that the single file is a problem when working 
with huge databases, then I'll probably write 
two separate commands "dump" and "load" that work with 
separate text files to hold the raw data.
But that day has still to come.


Miscellaneous
-------------

- The directory :file:`/var/log/lino/backups`
  contained 108 files, all named like `b20130503_020101.py`.
  Deleted 70 of them.
  (Yes, one day I want to write a cron job which does that automatically.)

- Upgraded on :ref:`lf`.

- fixed a bug in watch_tim



Installing Guest Additions for VirtualBox
-----------------------------------------

A beginner discovering the world of virtual boxes...

I have many files which I'd like to see from both 
operating systems (Ubuntu and Windows XP).
What I need is `Shared Folders
<http://www.virtuatopia.com/index.php/VirtualBox_Shared_Folders>`_.

To access shared folders from a virtual machine I need 
the `Guest Additions <http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html>`_.
But I cannot install them because I don't have a "Devices" menu.

A problem which has been reported before me:
`Where is the Devices menu of a Windows virtual machine?
<http://askubuntu.com/questions/179799/where-is-the-devices-menu-of-a-windows-virtual-machine>`_


Seems that I installed the wrong version 
(downloaded directly from Oracle, but apparently there's a more 
free one).
There is VirtualBox and VirtualBox, don't mix them up!
`Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VirtualBox>`_ explains it all.

Removed the following line from :file:`/etc/apt/sources.list`::

  deb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian oneiric contrib

::

  $ sudo aptitude purge virtualbox-4.2
  The following packages will be REMOVED:  
  dkms{u} libsdl-ttf2.0-0{u} python-central{u} virtualbox-4.2 
  0 packages upgraded, 0 newly installed, 4 to remove and 5 not upgraded.
  
  $ sudo aptitude install virtualbox-ose
  $ sudo aptitude install virtualbox-guest-additions
  
  
Now I have::  

    $ aptitude search virtualbox

another hope::

    $ sudo reboot
    $ sudo aptitude install virtualbox
    
This time it worked.
"It worked" means that I am back to where I was 2 hours ago: 
a virtual machine without guest additions and thus no shared folders.
And no "Devices" menu.

Now at least the following works without error messages::

    $ sudo aptitude install virtualbox-guest-additions

Although it doesn't seem to change anything...
But ha! `dpkg --listfiles virtualbox-guest-additions-iso` shows me that 
this package just adds an `.iso` file in :file:`/usr/lib/virtualbox`.
Mounted this as new a CD drive under "Storages" in the Settings, 
which became visible in the VM as a new CD drive, 
then ran the autorun installer on this CD from inside Windows.
Yes, that seems to work.

Now I have a `\\vboxsrv` server visible in my network environment.

But it is empty. Trying to access it with `net use` gives 
a system error 67::

  C:\>net use v: \\vboxsvr\vbshared
  
  System error 67 has occured
  
  The network name cannot be found
  
Another problem is that the clipboard doesn't seem to communicate. 
I tried both bidirectional and Guest to Host, but in the end I 
typed (!) myself the above text.

Bref: I don't see the share which I had already defined in 
the "Shared Folders" section of the settings of the VM.
  
Aha, seems that I must mark my folder as "shared". 
Nautilus, right click on that folder... now, there are two 
possibilities: choose "Sharing Options" from the context menu, 
or choose "Properties" and then the  "Share" tab.
Seems that they both do the same.

Marked them all as shared, giving read and write permission to 
everybody: nothing. Later even a `chmod -R a+w vbshared2`
Restart the Guest, restart the Host: nothing.
The `\\vboxsrv` server is visible in my network environment, 
but it is empty:

All this is happening on Ubuntu LTS 12.04 and I just 
did an `aptitude safe-upgrade`. 


One observation: when I start the VM from a shell, then I see 
a "Permission denied" error message::

  $ virtualbox --startvm "Windows XP"
  Error opening file for reading: Permission denied
