When rendering a slave table as html, the column headers were 
clickable as if for changing the sort order, 
but clicking on them didn't work.
Now they are no longer clickable.

Yesterday I made a few minor internal changes. 
One of them is that ActionRequest instances no longer have an `ui` 
attribute.
This had created a bug which I discovered only today because 
it had slipped through our test suite.
Let's call this kind of bugs "one-day bugs" because they lived
only for a short time.
But they are still bugs, and it is good to learn from them:
added a new snippet in
:ref:`welfare.tested.debts`
to reproduce it.

New attribute :attr:`lino.core.tables.AbstractTable.hide_zero_rows` 
is a practical solution for tables like JobProvidersAndContracts 
in the ActivityReport.


Released Lino 1.6.9 and Lino-Welfare 1.1.6
------------------------------------------

Also had to release new versions of north and djangosite because of the 
new function :func:`djangosite.dbutils.inrange_filter`.
