Aha, Frank Cornelis wrote an article 
`Belgian EID Security
<http://cup-of-java.blogspot.com/2008/05/belgian-eid-security.html>`_
where he gives a summary of what I've found in the source code 
of eid-applet. As an example he explains how to retrieve the national 
number. And especially he explains:

  The identity file itself has a simple Tag Length Value structure. 
  The national number has Tag number 6. 
  
After discovering what means `TLV <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-length-value>`_
I discovered files like
`TlvParser.java 
<https://code.google.com/p/eid-applet/source/browse/trunk/eid-applet-service/src/main/java/be/fedict/eid/applet/service/impl/tlv/TlvParser.java>`_
and understood why my yesterday's version of EIDReader didn't display 
more information: the second tag is the chip number, and this value 
contains 0x00 bytes which are meant to be converted by 
`ChipNumberDataConvertor <https://code.google.com/p/eid-applet/source/browse/trunk/eid-applet-service/src/main/java/be/fedict/eid/applet/service/impl/tlv/ChipNumberDataConvertor.java>`_.

And `ChipNumberDataConvertor` is `
not the only one <https://code.google.com/p/eid-applet/source/browse/trunk/eid-applet-service/src/main/java/be/fedict/eid/applet/service/impl/tlv/>`_
...

All this is so complex that copying this code would 
not lead to any sustainable result.
So I must import, not copy, parts of eid-applet into my applet.
