Multiple sites in one database
------------------------------

Cool! 
I had for the first time a need for what normal Django prople do
with their `"sites" framework
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/sites/>`_.

I just needed to change the getter of the `site_config` property 
so that it uses a configurable value :setting:`config_id` instead of 
the hard-coded ``1``.

:setting:`config_id` is the Lino equivalent of Django's 
:setting:`SITE_ID` setting.
Lino applications don't need ``django.contrib.sites`` because this 
functionality is integral part of :mod:`lino.modlib.system`.
Lino implements it a bit differently: main difference is that the 
model instance is cached in memory instead of working with a middleware.



TODO: SiteConfig.next_partner_id doesn't work as it should with 
multiple `config_id`. Possible solutions: 

- convert it (back) to a class attribute
- make it's usage optional
