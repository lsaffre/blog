Comparing two databases
-----------------------

How can you say whether two databases have the same content?

Answer: compare their "diagnostic database reports",
i.e. the output of a
:mod:`manage.py diag <lino.management.commands.diag>` 
on each of them.
The main purpose of this report is to have a "hash code" 
of a database in human-readable form.

I once wrote this command 
and almost never used it so far.

Now I moved the code to generate this report from 
:mod:`lino.management.commands.diag` to 
:meth:`lino.ui.Site.get_db_overview_rst`
and added three test cases that check whether in has the expected result
when run on the demo databases for
:mod:`lino_welfare`,
:mod:`lino_patrols`
and
:mod:`lino_faggio`.
