Ross McFarland describes  
an idea to simply send the server startup signal
"at the end of your last app's models.py file"
in his post `Django Startup Signal (Sun 24 June 2012)
<http://www.xormedia.com/django-startup-signal/>`_.

It seems that this idea is perfect for Lino!
We just need to require that "lino" is the last application 
of :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS`.
No more need to override Django's 
`loaddata` and `dumpdata` commands, no more need 
for a `lino.runtime` module!

Adapted `/tutorials/uiless`.

Wrote :func:`lino_welfare.modlib.pcsw.migrate.migrate_from_1_0_11`.

(PS: almost perfect. 
See :doc:`0220` for a use case that caused problem.)
