==================================

New fixture `eiche2lino` for :ref:`faggio`. 
This will be used exactly once 
to make the initial import of data from 
miscellaneous sources. 
These files are of course not part of the code since they are confidential.
But how we import them is no secret (and is still being developed until 
the great day arrives).


Fixed a bug in 
:func:`lino.ui.views.plain_response` which caused plain ui to not maintain 
the selected language when selecting a command from the main menu.
Started new documentation page about :ref:`belref`.
