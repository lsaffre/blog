===================================

Before releasing a new version with the MergeAction bug fixed
I'd like to write a test case for this.
And before writing that test case I'd like to convert
the current testing framework (which uses fablib) 
to a normal one (callable using `setup.py test`).

For Lino, this conversion is now done. 

    $ python setup.py test
    
I can now run individual test cases::

    $ python setup.py test -s tests.PackagesTests
    $ python setup.py test -s tests.ProjectsTests.test_cosi
    
New module :mod:`lino.projects.cosi.tests.cosi_tests`
does already the preliminary stuff. 

I then realized that it is time for another split 
(which I have been planning for a few weeks): 

The new project :mod:`atelier`
contains those parts of :mod:`djangosite`
which are useful also without Django.
But :class:`atelier.test.SubProcessTestCase` is new.
