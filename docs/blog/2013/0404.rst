==================================

Yesterday and today I continued to work on the 
general Lino documentation and multilingual userdocs.

The page :ref:`welfare.jobs`
of the Lino-Welfare user manual is 
my next generation guinea pig for writing user 
documentation.
(The :ref:`welfare.clients` page is not good for 
too audacious experiments because it is being used 
as a document)

:mod:`djangosite.utils.sphinxconf` is now a package,
and the blogging logic is 
moved into a sepaarate module 
:mod:`djangosite.utils.sphinxconf.blog` 
to be used as a a Sphinx extension.

Another new Sphinx extension is :mod:`lino.utils.actordoc`.

:meth:`lino.ui.Site.login` no longer calls 
:func:`djangosite.dbutils.set_language`. 
Because in a multilingual userdocs we want to write `py2rst` 
examples which require a user because of their permission 
requirements, but they should render in the language of the 
current document.
