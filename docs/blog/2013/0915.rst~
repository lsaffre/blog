====================================

:ref:`davlink`
--------------

Added a message
"You must tell your client to let me read your file system."
to the applet.

Discovered `policytool`
and worked on the instructions in :doc:`/davlink/client`.


A bug 
-----

The new :class:`PdfTableAction <lino.utils.appy_pod.PdfTableAction>`
(:blogref:`20130912`) had caused a bug:
The printed tables did not respect any parameter values.
Because `Lino.list_action_handler` didn't yet call 
`panel.add_param_values`.
Fixed.
Added that call also in `Lino.row_action_handler`.

New command `fab ddt`
---------------------

Added a new command ``fab ddt`` (:func:`atelier.fablib.double_dump_test`).

- When there are "models with circular dependencies", the corresponding 
  message is no longer written to the .py file because the dependencies 
  are stored in a dict which is randomly sorted and thus caused false 
  failures in the ddt.
