=====================================


Application programmers who wrote their own custom actions 
must possibly revide their code:

- An action's run method is no longer expected to return a dict containing 
  the response, but that response is stored in a new attribute 
  ``response`` of the ActionRequest.
  

- The callback functions to be passed to 
  :meth:`lino.core.requests.BaseRequest.confirm` 
  or 
  :meth:`lino.core.requests.BaseRequest.add_callback` 
  must now accept a single argument `ar` which 
  represents the second web request.
