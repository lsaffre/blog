- The new module :mod:`djangosite.utils.fablib` 
  contains the library file for fabric on which I have 
  been working during the last weeks.

- Oops, the installation instruction in 
  :doc:`/tutorials/quickstart` didn't work 
  because my source distributions at http://lino-framework.org/dl weren't 
  correctly organized.
  (In fact I didn't test them at all)
  And the `--no-index` option was nonsense there: 
  it needs to consult PyPI because of all the other needed 
  packages (Django,Sphinx,unipath,...)
  
- Added a new fabric command `fab blog`.

Sequenced Stages
================

Jacky noticed an apparently innocent "typo" in 
the event calendar of the East Belgian Cyclists Federation
(`www.vor-cycling.be <http://www.vor-cycling.be/fr/events.html>`__):

  20.7 TRW : ETAPPE VON ANS NACH EUPEN und nicht anders rum.
  
As their webmaster I manage this calendar using a Lino application
:mod:`lino.projects.events`.

  
That wasn't a typo, here is how this event is being defined in the 
:mod:`lino.modlib.events.fixtures.vor`
fixture::

    yield event(strasse,20130720,
      "Etappenankunft Tour de la Région Wallonne (TRW)",
      "Aankomst etappe Tour de la Région Wallonne (TRW)",
      "Arrivée d'étape du Tour de la Région Wallonne (TRW)",
      cities=["Ans","Eupen"])

The explanation was that when querying a *simple* ManyToManyField 
(i.e. one without a `through
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/models/#intermediary-manytomany>`__)
clause)
you cannot guarantee to have the rows rendered in the same order 
as they have been created.
I had to define an intermediary Model 
:class:`Stage <lino.modlib.events.models.Stage>` 
to solve this.


Regenerating the html for this site also revealed some problems 
due to the recent changes.
Used this to write a test case:
:mod:`lino.modlib.events.tests`.

Continued with the test suite
-----------------------------

It turned out that my `djangodoctest` directive isn't usable.
But I found a new promising system: run_django_doctests.
The first examples which pass are 
:doc:`/tutorials/human/index`
and
:doc:`/tutorials/auto_create/index`.
