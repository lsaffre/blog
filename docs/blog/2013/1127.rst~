Upgrade to testlino
-------------------

Upgraded `testlino` in Eupen
to the newest development version.
This took more time than usual because most projects are now on github, 
so I had to adapt the "pull" procedure.

Tested the data migration.
Updated :func:`lino_welfare.migrate.migrate_from_1_1_10` to remove 
field `help_text` in `accounts.Group` and `accounts.Account`.
