Removing an inherited action
----------------------------

Continued on the :doc:`/todo`. An appearently innocent user request 
was:

-  Button "eID-Inhalt" wird im Empfang nicht benutzt. Raus.

How to "remove" an inherited action or collected from a table?
Most intuitive method is to explicitly set it to None.

But... 
this wasn't yet possible.
And I took three hours to solve this.
Much time for such a small optimization, 
but it is relatively subtle, and I decided that now it is time 
to start a new tutorial about :doc:`/tutorials/actions/index`
which tests the new feature and gives (or will give one day) a
good entry point for developers.

    
Fixed a bug in :class:`lino.modlib.cal.models.PanelEvents` which could 
cause an `UnboundLocalError "local variable 'me' referenced before 
assignment"`.


New action `ShowSlaveTable`
---------------------------

The new action 
:class:`dd.ShowSlaveTable <lino.core.actions.ShowSlaveTable>`
is useful when you want to add a button (in the top toolbar) which
opens a given slave table in a pop-up window.
This is useful when for ergonomic reasons the user doesn't want to 
see this slave table directly in the detail window.

Usage example is 
:class:`lino_welfare.modlib.reception.CreateNoteActionsByClient`.

The `window_size` of an actor was ignored until now.

When a table has only one column, Lino now automatically 
specifies `hideHeaders` on the `EditorGridPanel`.
