About uploads
-------------

In :ref:`welfare` we would like to change a few things about the
"Uploads" of a client. An "upload", currently, represents an external
document (not generated by Lino) which the user has scanned,
downloaded or received by email and wants to store in the database.

One thing is that the user interface is rather quirky (ticket
:doc:`/tickets/102`, which probably will be easier to work on after
:doc:`/tickets/101`), but in general we agree that these two tickets
are not vitally urgent.

But one concrete user request is to also register information on
things like medical attestations about handicaps for which the user
has no original document, they just trust their client that it exists,
or they saw the original with their eyes but did not want to scan and
upload it. But they *do* want to get reminded when the validity of
that document expires.

My first idea is to simply add `blank=True` for the `FileField`
defined in the :class:`dd.Uploadable
<lino.mixins.uploadable.Uploadable>` mixin.  And also for the
`mimetype` field of course.

This turns :class:`lino.modlib.uploads.models.Upload` into something
more general than an "uploaded file". I'd call it a "managed external
document".
