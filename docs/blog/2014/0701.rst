Today it took me a whole day for making :ref:`eidreader` available
using both the self-signed and the codegears-signed jars.

The most time-consuming was that I switched from make_ to paver_.
Which consisted of several tasks:

- I had to admit that I will never love make_
  (:file:`Makefile_before_paver` is there just to show why)

- I had to evaluate the available pythonic make tools. I looked at
  scons_, some others and finally found paver_.

- rewrite EIDReader's :file:`Makefile` into a `pavement.py
  <https://github.com/lsaffre/eidreader/blob/master/pavement.py>`_
  file.

.. _make: http://www.gnu.org/software/make/
.. _paver: http://paver.github.io/paver/
.. _scons: http://www.scons.org/

While doing the above I noticed another detail: the library `.jar`
files contained both signatures.  Thanks to Hamza Yerlikaya who asked
`Unsigning a signed jar
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1291978/un-signing-a-signed-jar>`_,
and thanks to `midnight commander
<https://www.midnight-commander.org/>`_ who made this easy.  This
"detail" might have been a hidden cause for earlier problems,
according to `What prevents Java from verifying signed jars with
multiple signature algorithms
