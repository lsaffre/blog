Wrote database migration for upgrading to :ref:`welfare` 1.1.19.

Last-minute change: removed field `cv.Study.success`, and the migrator
converts it to `SchoolingStates.success` in `cv.Study.state`.

Released Lino 1.6.14 and :ref:`welfare` 1.1.19 to PyPI.


What is more urgent? (1) working for :ref:`welcht` who are waiting
already so long for their next version, or (2) finding a second core
developer who helps me to make Lino better?  For today afternoon I
chose the latter.

Updated some places:

- http://trac.lino-framework.org/milestone/inside
- http://www.saffre-rumma.net/jobs/coredev.html

Released Lino 1.6.15 because otherwise :mod:`lino.hello` would fail.
