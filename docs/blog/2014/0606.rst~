Estonian places
---------------

The new package :mod:`lino.projects.estref` is the Estonian equivalent
of :ref:`belref`. But without the alternative plain user interface. 

I used it mainly to test :mod:`lino.modlib.countries.fixtures.est`
which is now a proof of concept for my vision of using :ref:`dpy` as
data format for maintaining the list of places of a country.


More documentation
------------------

- I discovered and fixed the documentation bug in :ref:`cosi.install`
  which was probably the main reason why Milton asked `Lino Cosi app
  installation <https://github.com/lsaffre/lino-cosi/issues/2>`_

- And I started :doc:`/dev/translate/index`, also dedicated to Milton.

And note that you must pull the newest version of Lino before trying
it, because there were some minor things missing, e.g. a Spanish demo
user "Rodrigo Rosalez".
