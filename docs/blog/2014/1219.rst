`sphinx.ext.autosummary` and imported members
=============================================

When building the docs for :ref:`welfare`, Sphinx told me::

    Warning, treated as error:
    <autodoc>:0: WARNING: Inline substitution_reference start-string without end-string.

Which caused my build to break unless I set my
:attr:`tolerate_sphinx_warnings <atelier.fablib.env.tolerate_sphinx_warnings>` to `True`
(and I don't want that).
    
The offending piece of markup is in Django::

    class Q(tree.Node):
        """
        Encapsulates filters as objects that can then be combined logically (using
        & and |).
        """
    
This string was indeed included in the summary table of
:mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.pcsw.models`.
    
It took me several hours to understand the problem, 
and finally I
posted my solution to the Sphinx tracker as
`#1654 autosummary should ignore imported members
<https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx/issue/1654>`_.


A filtering problem on :actor:`pcsw.Clients`
============================================

Now let's have a look at :ticket:`46`.

The problem is in
:meth:`lino_welfare.modlib.pcsw.models.Clients.get_request_queryset`.
The solution is probably easy: I must do `add_coachings_filter` only
when an `observed_event` has been specified.

TODO: The test suite now fails. Which is normal.  In general I must
write more detailed test cases for the filter parameters of
:actor:`pcsw.Clients`.  Especially I must analyze whether there is
danger of having side effects.
