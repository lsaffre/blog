Social agents
-------------

In :ref:`welfare`, the first *general social agents* (not integration
agents) started to use Lino.  In the demo database this is user
"judith" with UserProfile 400.

Added new user group "Coaching".  Both Integration agents and General
Social agents are members of this group.
Adapted :meth:`lino_welfare.settings.Site.setup_choicelists`.

Note that "Coaching" is my particular translation of "Begleitung"; I
am afraid that it is not the right word but could not find a better
candidate.

Changed the `user_groups` requirement of certain tables from `integ`
to `coaching`.


TODO: 

- why does demo user judith see the Competences panel of ClientDetail?
  The `competences` panel in `pcsw.ClientDetail` is defined with
  required=usergroups='integ'.  It probably has to do with the
  `loosen_requirements` method, but here be dragons. I should first
  write test cases to test which layout elements are visible to a
  given user profile...

- Demo `integ.UsersWithClients` continues to show all users who are
  members of the `integ` user group (i.e. with an `integ_level`).
