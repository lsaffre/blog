The Lino logo
-------------

:srcref:`docs/tickets/94`.

After long discussions and meditations, also with Manuel, Ly now
presents an almost final version for the Lino logo:

.. image:: 0303.png
    :scale: 20%

You might notice that this is almost the same as one of the version
presented on :blogref:`20140118`. But ask Manuel: we have tried many
alternatives, just to return, in the end to the conclusion that Ly's
first spontaneous draft was more close to what we want than everything
we ever *believed* to want.

Sphinx was innocent
-------------------

There was a problem in Sphinx with my :mod:`atelier.sphinxconf`
because I had added "from __future__ import unicode_literals".  This
seems fixed now without any patch to Sphinx. Sphinx was innocent.



Miscellaneous
-------------

In :mod:`lino.modlib.contacts.fixtures.demo` I tested for::

  if 'de' in settings.SITE.languages:

which evaluates always to `False` because :setting:`languages`
contains `LanguageInfo` instances, not strings. Here is what I
actually wanted to do there::

  if settings.SITE.get_language_info('de'):




I changed the user-visible names (`verbose_name` and
`verbose_name_plural`) in :mod:`lino.modlib.attestations` from
"Attestation" to "Printout". One day I'll rename the whole
module. Because "printout" is shorter than "attestation" and because
also Gerd preferred "Ausdruck" to "Bescheinigung".

I added a new field `time` to :class:`lino.modlib.notes.Note`.

In :mod:`lino.mixins` I split `CreatedModified` into two separate
mixins :class:`dd.Created <lino.mixins.Created>` :class:`dd.Modified
<lino.mixins.Modified>`.  Only after doing this I realized that --at
least for the new `notes.Note.time` field -- it is not needed

Should RequestField render an empty cell when there are no rows in the
request?
