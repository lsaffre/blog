Lino Faggio
-----------

Started to update :ref:`faggio.changes`.

Added new virtual field `linked_date` ("Date") in
`EventsByCourse`. This makes the date of each event clickable, and
clicking it opens a table with all events on that day.

(Unofficial) release of :ref:`faggio` version 0.0.3 for Roger.


Lino Welfare
------------

New app module :mod:`lino.modlib.sepa`.  
Using this app requires Ben Konrath's `django-iban
<https://github.com/benkonrath/django-iban>`_ module.  Note that I did
not declare this dependency for Lino (the framework) since many Lino
user's won't need it. But I did add it to the `install_requires` of
:ref:`welfare`.

The "Aids" tab of :class:`lino_welfare.modlib.pcsw.PersonDetail` now
shows the slave table `sepa.AccountsByPartner`.  Removed the two bank
account fields.


The `managed` checkbox field is a specific addition by
:ref:`welfare`. It indicates whether a client account is being
"managed" by the social assistant.


I discovered that some files in :ref:`welfare` had "This file is part
of the Lino-Faggio project."  in their copyright header. Replaced
these by "This file is part of the Lino Welfare project."
