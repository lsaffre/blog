More about taglist
------------------

The author of `sphinxcontrib-taglist
<https://github.com/spinus/sphinxcontrib-taglist>`_
helped me to understand how to use it. 
        
His explanation:


    You have::

      .. tag:: blog docs

    but it should be like::

      .. tag:: [blog docs] Some text

    or::

      .. tag:: Some text
        :tag: blog docs

    The main idea was to 'tag' some piece of information, not the page as
    whole. So you need provide 'Some text' which you want to tag.

What I really want
------------------

But then I realized that I want even more (or maybe less): I don't
want to specify a text for each occurence of a `tag`. I "just" want a
directive that inserts a list of "pages referring to this".  

For example when I write in the present blog entry the present
sentence which mentions :ref:`datamig` or :ref:`faggio` (which for me
is are well-known concepts, and I know that I have somewhere an
article about it), then I want on both of these pages, after having
explained that concept, in a section "Pages referring to this", a
reference to this blog entry. A simulation:

    **Data migration**

    Data migration is bla bla bla

    **Pages referring to this**
