===========================

I continued to work in the documentation. And there are again classes
moving around.  So I recommend to use the latest development version
until the next release.

:mod:`lino.utils.html2xhtml` is problematic because it makes Lino
depend on `tidylib`.  

And then it turns out that in newer verions of tidylib the
`show-body-only
<http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/quickref.html#show-body-only>`_ has
no effect when `output-xml
<http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/quickref.html#output-xml>`_ is also
is requested.  Which is exactly the combination I need.  A Russian
user in `Prevent tidy from adding html tags
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1963298/prevent-tidy-from-adding-html-tags>`_
had the same problem.

I tried to revitalize my replacement for tidylib (now in separate
module :mod:`lino.utils.mytidylib`), but that's really hard.

Solution for Lino is to use `output-xhtml
<http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/quickref.html#output-xhtml>`_
instead of `output-xml
<http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/quickref.html#output-xml>`_.

On readthedocs.org the build still fails because they don't have the
binary HtmlTidy library installed.
