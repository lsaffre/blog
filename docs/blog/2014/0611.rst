Excerpts also for Cos√¨
----------------------

DONE:

- Added :mod:`lino.modlib.excerpts` to :ref:`cosi`.  
  :class:`ml.sales.Invoice` is now :class:`lino.modlib.excerpts.Certifiable`.

- Started to document :mod:`ml.sales`.
- Renamed field "invoicing_address" to "invoice_recipient"


- The new :mod:`lino.modlib.excerpts.fixtures.std` fixture
  automatically creates a certifying :class:`lino.modlib.excerpts.ExcerptType`
  instance for every model which inherits from
  :class:`lino.modlib.excerpts.Certifiable`.

- Cool: the new method :meth:`lino.core.site.Site.str2kw` used for the above
  fixture is also the beginning of a solution for :srcref:`docs/tickets/108`.

So :class:`ml.sales.Invoice` is no longer `TypedPrintable` but
:class:`lino.modlib.excerpts.Certifiable`. This currently means that every app
which uses :mod:`ml.sales` must also install :mod:`lino.modlib.excerpts`.
Hm... Can we leave this as this? Do we need automatic management of
dependencies (i.e. :attr:`lino.core.plugin.Plugin.requires`)?

- Another example why we need app dependencies is sepa and iban.


TODO:

- add :mod:`ml.addresses` to :ref:`cosi`
- AddressesBy


Free default data for places and zip codes
------------------------------------------

Continued on :srcref:`docs/tickets/109`.

:ref:`dpy` : Django sometimes seems to also load fixtures from current
directory.  This was disturbing while writing `cosi.tested.estonia`
because the following then caused a "Fixture has no attribute
objects":

  $ cd lino_cosi/settings/est
  $ python manage.py initdb_demo
