=========================

The new `edit_mode` request parameter and the `stay_in_grid` actor
attribute now to work. First use case is `pcsw.AddressesByClient`:
double-clicking here on the phantom record will show the insert window
and then (after confirming that window) **stay in the grid**,
i.e. **not** open a detail window on the newly created row.

Bank accounts by partner. Worked on 
:mod:`lino.modlib.sepa` and
:mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.sepa`.
Moved some functionality into a separate new module
:mod:`lino.modlib.iban`.


Fixed a problem in :mod:`north.dpy`: new method finalize() now reports
unresolved rows. Also changed the implementation of `after_load`.
