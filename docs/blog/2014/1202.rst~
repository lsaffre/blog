Continued the changes started :doc:`yesterday <1201>`.

Converted :mod:`lino.projects.docs` to the now recommended structure
with Django settings in a separate directory::

  mkdir settings
  mv settings.py settings/__init.py
 
and then create files :xfile:`demo.py` and :xfile:`memory.py`.

Checkin and upgrade on :ref:`lf`.
