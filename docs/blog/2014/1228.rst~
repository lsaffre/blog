===================================

In the :ref:`dblog <dblog>` repo, I removed the now useless files
below the `docs/2015` directory. And the `conf.py` added two useless
Sphinx extensions. And it should now work also for people who don't
have :mod:`lino` installed.

Started a new section of the documentation tree: :doc:`/team/index`.
