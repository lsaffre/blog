========================

A thing which had been waiting for a long time because it is purely
internal: I changed the format of the `atelier` config file.  This had
become necessary because recent changes had broken the possibility to
manage Sphinx doctrees without a corresponding Python module. It
caused a welter of subtle changes which influence the configuration of
:mod:`atelier`.


:ref:`mw` stumbled over a bug that had passed the test suite on my
development machine because I had not tidied up my `.pyc` files for
several months.

The bug itself was trivial, :mod:`lino.modlib.pages` still did::

   from lino.modlib.plain.renderer import PlainRenderer

Which (since :blogref:`20140729`) should have been::

   from lino.modlib.bootstrap3.renderer import Renderer

But it is of course rather time-consuming to diagnose such bugs.

How can I make sure to avoid this problem? IOW How to tidy up `.pyc`
files in a repository which I never pull from outside?  Okay I wrote a
`fab pyc` command which removes `.pyc` files that don't have a
corresponding `.py` file.  But will I remember to run this command
when it is time to do so?
