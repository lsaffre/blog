- Some translations to DE

- Added test cases in :ref:`welfare.tested.misc` for printing excerpts.

  This makes use of appy.pod's new `raiseOnError=True` option and
  detected one (minor) bug: a jobs.Contract failed to print when a
  `company` without `contact_person` was given.
  

- Added a default picture used by :class:`welfare.pcsw.Client`.  TODO:
  this would be a first use case for Django's staticfiles.

- The tables returned by :meth:`lino.core.site.Site.get_admin_main_items` are
  displayed with a limit of 5 by default. Until now you had to rewrite
  the whole ``hello_user`` block in :xfile:`admin_main_base.html`.
  Now it is enough to add a line to your :xfile:`admin_main.html`::

        {% set admin_item_limit = 20 %}
        {% extends "admin_main_base.html" %}

- Changed the order of items yeld by
  :meth:`lino.core.site.Site.get_admin_main_items` in :ref:`welfare`.
