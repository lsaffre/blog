Formatting IBAN numbers
-----------------------

Lino now renders IBAN numbers as it should:
"EE87 2200 2210 1206 7904" instead of "EE872200221012067904".

The first challenge was a decision: should we store the spaces in the
database or not?  My current answer is: we don't store the spaces, we
use a renderer to insert them dynamically.

This is more or less compatible to `django-iban
<https://github.com/benkonrath/django-iban>`_ who currently just
accepts spaces and removes them forever (but does not render them
formatted).

The second challenge was how to implement this.  The `commit
<https://github.com/lsaffre/lino/commit/3748768ed9d8b3e0f4e616d4378562cb7d787078>`_
shows what I did.  I made changes in :mod:`lino.modlib.iban.fields`
and :srcref:`/lino/modlib/iban/config/uppercasetextfield.js` (those in
:mod:`lino.ui.elems` are rather cosmetic).  Thanks to `How to insert
space every 4 characters for IBAN registering?
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17260238/how-to-insert-space-every-4-characters-for-iban-registering>`_
asked in March 2014 by `Jackyto

`David Thomas <http://stackoverflow.com/users/82548/david-thomas>`_

The current solution has some drawbacks:

- Works only in a grid (IBAN fields in a Detail window are not
  formatted. Which is not a problem since we currently have no
  occurence of this case).
- Pressing F2 to start editing causes the formatting to disappear
  (waiting for user feedback on this).
- We will also need a renderer for plain HTML and plain text.


ParameterStore on pcsw.Clients expects a list of 12 values but got 16
---------------------------------------------------------------------

I discovered an urgent bug:

- Wenn ich eine Klientenliste über ein RequestField (von
  UsersWithClients aus) öffne und dort auf einem Klienten
  doppelklicke, kriege ich::

    Exception
    ParameterStore of LayoutHandle for ParamsLayout on pcsw.Clients expected a list of 12 values, but got [u'30', u'200096', u'', u'29.04.2014', u'29.04.2014', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'', u'false', u'', u'', u'1', u'false', u'false']

    TRACEBACK:
    File "/usr/local/django/testlino/env/lib/python2.6/site-packages/django/core/handlers/base.py", line 114, in get_response
    (...)
    File "/home/lsaffre/repositories/lino/lino/core/requests.py", line 822, in __init__
    request))
    File "/home/lsaffre/repositories/lino/lino/ui/store.py", line 949, in parse_params
    self, len(self.param_fields), pv))


Worked several hours on it, without success until now.  I encapsulated
some code into `install_layout` in order to use the same logic for
`params_layout` where this was not yet done. But that was not the reason.

Why does a GET to ``/api/integ/Clients/177`` use the ParameterStore
defined on `pcsw.Clients`!?  Yes, `integ.Clients` inherits from
`pcsw.Clients`, but it even specifies its own `parameters` and
`params_layout` (so my `install_layout` above was of course useless).


Started new tested document :ref:`welfare.tested.integ` which
reproduces the problem.

The problematic code was this::

        elems += [
            E.br(), ar.instance_action_button(obj.create_household)]

Here `obj.create_household` instantiates an `InstanceAction` on a
Person's `create_household`.  The application code is okay, but we
must decide whether or not `ar.instance_action_button` should parse
`ar.request` (i.e. the web request which caused the current request).
In the above case it may not.  But here be dragons. Not sure whether
this will cause problems elsewhere.  The API for rendering action
buttons is not yet what I would call "stable".

Cool: I added a `get_slave_summary` method to
`UploadsByController`. This will make our "quick upload buttons"
needless! Not yet finished, but promising.

Checkin wegen Feierabend.

More bugs to fix:

- IBAN numbers don't seem to get validated.

- The Insert window of an Upload has a layout problem.  I guess that
  the `Lino.FileUploadField` doesn't collaborate well with the auto
  height.

- Inserting in UploadsByClient sets the `owner` but not the `client`.
