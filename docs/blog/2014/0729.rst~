================================

I discovered and am investigating a bug in :xfile:`linoweb.js`. It
happens when adding a new record to a grid using cell editing (which
currently requires the user to press :kbd:`F2`). The bug is not very
urgent since the current production sites don't really use this entry
method. Most people even don't know it. But it is necessary in an
accounting application. It is a show stopper for :ref:`cosi`.  I want
to fix this bug. But it is a good one.

As usual when I must do some job which I don't love, I find
distractions.  For example Ly watched one of my private blog pages and
complained that you cannot start to page through all photos after
having clicked on a first one.  I concluded that she is right.
:mod:`atelier/sphinxconf/sigal_image` now uses `lightbox
