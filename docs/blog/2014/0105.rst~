==================================

I saw from the django developers list that Aymeric is really talented,
there is hope that he will get the new apps management usable for
Lino!  Added a note to :blogref:`20140101` and worked on
:doc:`/dev/apps` in order to document what Lino actually wants to do.

.. currentmodule:: lino.modlib.ledger.models

Following a surprising intuition and in surprisingly little time
(given the fact that I haven't been busy with this subject for weeks),
I wrote another set of reports that were still missing in :ref:`cosi`:
:class:`Debtors` and :class:`Creditors`.  Both reports are tables with
one row for each partner having a positive balance (either debit or
credit).  Accessible via the new menu entries :menuselection:`Reports
--> Ledger --> Debtors` and :menuselection:`Reports --> Ledger -->
Creditors`.  (Entspricht den Listen "Offene Posten Kunden" und "Offene
Posten Lieferanten" aus TIM.)

Also worked on the docs of :mod:`lino.modlib.ledger.models`.  This
module wouldn't be angry for having a few classes split out into
separate modules.

TODO: 

- adapt demo fixtures to generate sensible debtors and creditors
- adapt test suites



Upgrade to Ubuntu 13.04
-----------------------

I upgraded my machine to Ubuntu 13.04

Afterwards I had to do rebuild all my virtual environments because 
something inside Python has changed. 
Once you know the explanation, it's easy::

  $ virtualenv pythonenvs/foo

Git also asked me to make a decision::

    warning: push.default is unset; its implicit value is changing in
    Git 2.0 from 'matching' to 'simple'. To squelch this message
    and maintain the current behavior after the default changes, use:

      git config --global push.default matching

    To squelch this message and adopt the new behavior now, use:

      git config --global push.default simple

    See 'git help config' and search for 'push.default' for further information.
    (the 'simple' mode was introduced in Git 1.7.11. Use the similar mode
    'current' instead of 'simple' if you sometimes use older versions of Git)

I didn't really understand the explanation of 'push.default' but
chose to maintain the current behavior::
    
    git config --global push.default matching


Moved Lino-Cos√¨ to a separate project
-------------------------------------

:ref:`cosi` is no longer a subpackage of :mod:`lino.projects` but 
has its own code repository at https://github.com/lsaffre/lino-cosi
The advantage is that I can now start to write userdocs.

- Test suites are not yet fully adapted.
- docs and userdocs aren't yet available on lino-framework.org
