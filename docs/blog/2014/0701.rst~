Today it took me a whole day for making :ref:`eidreader` available
using both the self-signed and the codegears-signed jars.

The most time-consuming was that I switched from make_ to paver_.
Which consisted of several tasks:

- admit that I will never love make_ (:file:`Makefile_before_paver` is
  there just to show why)

- evaluate the available pythonic make tools. I looked at scons, some
  others and finally found paver_

- rewrite EIDReader's :file:`Makefile` into a `pavement.py
  <https://github.com/lsaffre/eidreader/blob/master/pavement.py>`_
  file.


.. _make: http://www.gnu.org/software/make/
.. _paver: http://paver.github.io/paver/
