New European VAT regulation
===========================

Lino is so cool!  It seems that I solved :ticket:`42` (New European
VAT regulation) within a few hours!  Okay there might be some details
which might require attention when first users start to actually use
it ;-) But all in all I am proud. When I read `how a taxation change
took 4 developers a week to handle
<http://blog.pythonanywhere.com/105/>`_, I got afraid and decided that
it might be time to start working on this ticket.  But unlike the
developers at PA I have over 20 years of experience with handling VAT
in an accounting software, so these topics were not new to me.
Everything went as planned:

- Added the new model :mod:`lino.modlib.vat.models.VatRate`
  (:ref:`mustmig`).
- New fixture with the rates I know
  :mod:`lino.modlib.vat.fixtures.euvatrates`.
- Moved documentation from :mod:`ml.vat` to :mod:`lino.modlib.vat`.

- En passant I noticed that :attr:`hide_sums
  <lino.core.actors.Actor.hide_sums>` was being ignored by
  :meth:`lino.core.actors.Actor.to_rst`.



Installed latest development version on :ref:`lf`.  And another good
news: It seems that :manage:`initdb` now works also on InnoDB because
it calls :meth:`disable_constraint_checking`. So the problem described
in :ref:`innodb` has gone.
