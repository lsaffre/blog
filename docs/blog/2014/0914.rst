Added streets of Tallinn (copied from
http://www.eki.ee/knab/tallinn1.htm) to :mod:`lino.utils.demonames`.

Discovered that 
(according to `this
<https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/13225804>`_)
the English word for "linnaosa" is not "township" but "district".
Later I decided to keep "township" nevertheless.

Restructured :mod:`lino_faggio.settings` into
:mod:`lino_faggio.projects`. Yes, we don't have simply "Lino Faggio",
we now have three variants of Lino Faggio: the sterile "docs" variant
which is not used in reality but for testing docs, then "à la Roger" and
now a new "à la Edmund" variant.
