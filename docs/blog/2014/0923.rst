===========================

Preparing an upgrade in :ref:`weleup`. Making the test suites pass.

Changed a detail in the implementation of :mod:`ml.beid`: Until
yesterday, when `lino.core.site.Site.use_java` was False, ``beid`` and ``davlink``
were *not installed* at all.  This was a strange behaviour which
caused quite some subtle problems.  The :class:`ml.beid.BeIdCardTypes`
choicelist now has `app_label` ``beid`` instead of ``lino``.

Oh dear, and then I yet did another thing which nobody asked: I moved
(most of) the Javascript code specific to :ref:`davlink` from
`linoweb.js` and `admin_main_base.html` into the :mod:`ml.davlink`
module.  This is also the first action which Nobody asked for it and
it potentially brings bugs, *but* it make Lino more understandable and
is a preparation for :srcref:`docs/tickets/101`.  And the danger is
relatively low.
