Steve Johnson replied (see :doc:`yesterday <0628>`), and I invested
two more hours in trying to understand what's wrong. Without success.

Worked on :mod:`atelier.sphinxconf.configure`.

- Lino logo now also on the :ref:`welfare` pages. 
  This required a `centeredlogo.css` to look nice.

- add an extlinks entry
  `:XXX_srcref:` for every project which has a name ``srcref_url``
  defined in its main module.

After committing the above I *still* continued to think about it.

The `centeredlogo` thing was not a generally useful extension.

- Moved `lino.utils.actordoc` to :mod:`lino.sphinxcontrib.actordoc`.
- Added :mod:`lino.sphinxcontrib.logo` centralizes has both the static
  files and css.


Worked on :srcref:`docs/tickets/113`. Two points are now solved:

- VouchersByPartner should show a shortcurt link to unregistered
  vouchers (i.e. to their MTI children).

- A sales invoice is created in table ledger_invoice instead of
  sales_invoice. Seems that there is some misundertanding when
  generating the `insert_button` in
  the :meth:`dd.AbstractTable.get_slave_summary` of
  :class:`ml.ledger.VouchersByPartner`.

The last one, "Lino does not show the detail window on the created
invoice", is more difficult.
