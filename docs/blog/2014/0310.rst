Mise en route du Lino au CPAS de Ch√¢telet
-----------------------------------------

Worked with Mathieu to prepare meetings with end-users in the next
days.

:meth:`lino_welfare.modlib.jobs.models.Contract.disabled_fields`
caused an ISE in certain situations because it still used a list, not
a set.


One advantage of having switched to GitHub is that they have good
documentation. For example `Using SSH over the HTTPS port
<https://help.github.com/articles/using-ssh-over-the-https-port>`_.



I forked `get_next_date` into two similar methods
`get_next_suggested_date` and `get_next_alt_date`.  The former is what
we are used to, the latter is to be used when trying to find an
alternative date.

Lino was not yet able to manage recurrencies of type "Monthly, but
never put on Sunday or Saturday". Not it is.  The "weekdays" now apply
to every Recurrency.  `Recurrencies.per_weekday` is now deprecated.
Data migrations should convert `per_weekday` to `daily`.
