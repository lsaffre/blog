Forwarding slave tables
-----------------------

:class:`lino.modlib.households.models.SiblingsByPerson` is like
:class:`lino.modlib.outbox.models.SentByPartner`.  

I'd suggest to call this usage pattern a "forwarding slave table".



Thoughs about :mod:`lino.modlib.households`.

Should there be a field `Househould.head`? Because in fact a
Household *must* have a "Head of household". This is a case for a
mandatory field (not nullable).

On the other hand the head of a household is also a member.  We want a
table `households.MembersByPerson`, and that table should show all
households of that person.

Can a person be member of more than one households *at a given time*?
This is technically possible, but it should lead to a plausibility
warning.

The role of a membership: should this be a database model or a
choicelist?
