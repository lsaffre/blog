=====================================

Uff, the explanation for :doc:`/tickets/99` was complex:

First I had to learn that this was a case of logging *before*
:func:`lino.utils.log.configure` was run. That's why my first series of
instantiation was never shown.

It is also possible that Lino did not correctly detect whether logging
is already configured.

Second I had forgotten that `override_defaults` is also called from
:mod:`djangosite.utils.djangotest`.
