=======================

I made an upgrade of the online demo sites (:ref:`demos`) while
somebody was exploring it (sorry).

I keep receiving `PermissionDenied` server tracebacks per email saying
"As Anonyme you have no permission to run this action".  It seems that
they are all caused by standard AJAX requests as Lino uses, except
that these ones are anonymous.  And I continue to ignore how to
reproduce them.
