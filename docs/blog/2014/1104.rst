=========================

The functionality of sending an excerpt by email was completely broken
because not yet adapted to multiple template groups support.  The
template at
:file:`lino/lino/modlib/excerpts/config/excerpts/Excerpt/Default.eml.html`
was still in Cheetah syntax.  When trying to select a
:attr:`ml.excerpt.ExcerptType.email_template`, Lino raised a
`TypeError` "object of type 'NoneType' has no len()".
