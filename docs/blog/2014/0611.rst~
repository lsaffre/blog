DONE:

- Added :mod:`ml.excerpts` to :ref:`cosi`.  
  :class:`ml.sales.Invoice` is now :class:`ml.excerpts.Certifiable`.

- Started to document :mod:`ml.sales`.
- Renamed field "invoicing_address" to "invoice_recipient"


- The new :mod:`lino.modlib.excerpts.fixtures.std` fixture
  automatically creates a certifying :class:`ml.excerpts.ExcerptType`
  instance for every model which inherits from
  :class:`ml.excerpts.Certifiable`.

- Cool: the new method :meth:`ad.Site.str2kw` used for the above
  fixture is also the beginning of a solution for :doc:`/tickets/108`.

So :class:`ml.sales.Invoice` is no longer `TypedPrintable` but
:class:`ml.excerpts.Certifiable`. This currently means that every app
which uses :mod:`ml.sales` must also install :mod:`ml.excerpts`.
Hm... Can we leave this as this? Do we need automatic management of
dependencies (i.e. :attr:`ad.Plugin.requires`)?

- Another example why we need  


TODO:

- add :mod:`ml.addresses` to :ref:`cosi`
- AddressesBy
