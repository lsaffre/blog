Miscellaneous
=============

Yesterday's UnicodeEncode bug in :mod:`lino.modlib.beid` was not yet
correctly fixed. I am shooting from the hip because my Belgian eID
card contains only ASCII characters, so I cannot easily test this.

Joe contributed a `bugfix <https://gitlab.com/lino-framework/lino/pull/18>`_ 
for :mod:`lino.modlib.export_excel`.

Converted also the :ref:`davlink` Makefile to `fabfile.py`. The logic
for building java classes and jars is now in
:class:`atelier.fablib.JarBuilder`.


How to use an EMT netipulk
==========================

Trying to use an "EMT netipulk". When I connect the device, I get a
dialog box "SIM PIN unlock required", enter the PIN, and then I can
use the connection (I must manually select it from the network menu).

But sometimes the dialog box doesn't come, and the Broadcase Network
remains disabled. dmesg says::

This is normal except for the last line.
