================================

We decided to re-activate the :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.courses` app
for :mod:`lino_welfare.settings.fr`.  Then we discovered that the
:mod:`lino.modlib.courses` app is probably more suitable.  In fact not
exactly: e.g.

- TeacherType and PupilType are not needed
- pupils are always instances of `pcsw.Client`, 
  teachers are always instances of `users.User`.

Started :mod:`lino_welfare.settings.fr.pcsw` because it seems
clear that Chatelet and Eupen will need their own `ClientDetail`.

Started :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.sales` which is a Dmmy module to 
satisfy :mod:`lino.modlib.courses`.


A little API change
-------------------

ClientDetail used to show aa stupid `cal.EventsByProject` in the
Calendar tab. But this table did not detect events where the current
client is "only" a participant and not in the `Event.project` field.

To get this done I had to do a (minor) API change:
`lino.core.actors.Table.get_queryset` is now being called with the
ActionRequest as argument.

Before::

    @classmethod
    def get_queryset(self):

Now you must say::

    @classmethod
    def get_queryset(self, ar):
