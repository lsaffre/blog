A bug in :mod:`lino.modlib.export_excel`
----------------------------------------


A last thing to do for :srcref:`docs/tickets/123`:

- "Unexpected data type <class 'xml.etree.ElementTree.Element'>"
  bei Export Excel einer Tabelle mit virtuellen Feldern.


Instead of just fixing it, I rather feel like first writing a test
case to reproduce it.  But where?  Maybe using
:mod:`lino.projects.min1`? No, this application has no virtual fields.

Fixed a docstring in :mod:`lino.modlib.cal.utils` which caused a test
failure.

Maybe using :mod:`lino.projects.min2`?  Added more library modules
(addresses, sepa, humanlinks, households) to min2 in the hope to find
a situation where our problem occurs. Nope.

I then discovered that I even cannot reproduce it in :ref:`faggio`
anymore. The problem has vanished.  But in :ref:`faggio` I found and
fixed another little bug:

In :mod:`lino.modlib.export_excel`, added a function `sheet_name`
which removes more invalid characters from the title. For example
slashes ("/") are not allowed.


Worked on :ref:`presto`
------------------------
