==========================


I discovered that :mod:`ml.polls` is (maybe) what we need in
:ref:`welcht` for making the "plans d'action".  There is of course some
work to do since this module was not actually in a finished state.
Especially the `answer_buttons` field ("My answer") does not yet work
at all: it was not yet adapted to the multiple choices feature which I
had added shortly before interrupting this project.  This will
probably require a new feature of the framework: action calls with
arbitrary arguments.

Checkin before starting this new feature.

The test suite still had some failures due to the new
`EstonianAddressFormatter`

Last checkin (at 05:00 next day) instead of "action calls with
arbitrary arguments" we will probably do "actions with parameters but
without window". Selecting a choice now works... except for the
"detail" that it opens a window which the user must confirm.
