The Lino community is growing automatically: a GitHub user named
`raffas` had a look at Lino and asked a question `SITE objects has no
keywords 'str2kw' after update of 11/06/2014
<https://github.com/lsaffre/lino/issues/17>`_.  Which made me discover
that the :doc:`/dev/install` page still had some problems:

- `django-iban` was missing
- Modified a :blogref:`20131211` so that it works when :ref:`faggio`
  is not installed.
- Moved ``lino.projects.start`` to ``lino_cosi.settings.start``
  because it is actually a variant of :ref:`cosi` and caused the test
  suite to fail in a virgin installation as described on that page..

Note that the test suite of :ref:`welfare` is still broken... nothing
very serious, just some routine work to do...
