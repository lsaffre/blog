Rien n'est simple
-----------------

:ref:`cosi` failed because it uses
:mod:`ml.excerpts`
which in turn depends on 
:mod:`ml.outbox`
(which in turn depends on :mod:`ml.uploads`),
but does not install these dependencies.

The test suite failed to reveal this problem because
:ref:`cosi.tested.demo` was not being tested.

:ref:`new`: Thte new attribute :attr:`ad.Site.needs_plugins` makes it
possible to resolve such dependencies transparently.


The :attr:`dd.AbstractTable.start_at_bottom` option starts to work.
This was quite tricky. See the source code.
TODO:

- the `PagingToolbar.cursor` is set to -1, which leads to a wrong
  value for `getPageData().activePage`. Add an onload handler on
  `Lino.GridPanel` or `Lino.GridStore` which sets it to the correct
  value when it is -1.

- test for side effects
