Fixed some bugs in RecurrenceSet and EventGenerator which made it
impossible to create a RecurrentEvent with recurrency "once". 

:ref:`mustmig`: The `every_unit` field of
:class:`ml.cal.RecurrentEvent` is no longer nullable.

RecurrenceSet now saves the deprecated "per weekday" for `every_unit`
as "weekly".

Changed the format of `when_text`. People in Eupen are irritated by
dates formatted "2014 Aug 21 (Do.)".  Now they see "Do. 21.08.14".
