Lino as an SMTP server
----------------------

Started new module :mod:`lino.modlib.smtpd` which has no models but
defines a :manage:`recmail` management command and a 
:attr:`mail_received <lino.modlib.smtpd.signals.mail_received>`
signal.

Started new project :ref:`noi` which hooks
to that signal.  As a first step I just want to log every incoming
mail.

Now I start the server::

    $ go noi
    $ sudo -i
    # . /home/luc/pythonenvs/py27/bin/activate
    # python manage.py recmail
    

But when I try and send a mail to myself, Thunderbird says:

    An error occurred while sending mail. The mail server responded:
    Requested action not taken: mailbox unavailable

    invalid DNS A/AAAA resource record. Please check the message recipient
    luc@127.0.0.1 and try again.
