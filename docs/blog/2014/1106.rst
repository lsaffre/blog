==========================

Pulled in :ref:`welcht` to production server and migrated the database.

Fixed a bug in :mod:`lino.core.actions` which caused the
`toggle_choice` action to fail. `toggle_choice` is our first action
with parameters but no window (i.e. :attr:`lino.core.actions.Action.no_params_window`
set to True).

:mod:`ml.humanlinks` : uncle, cousin etc are now `addable_link_types`.

In :srcref:`docs/tickets/104` there was a last detail: 

The :class:`welfare.newcomers.AvailableCoaches` table no longer
displays coaches only for newcomers. So you can now use this table on
an active client to assign another coach.
