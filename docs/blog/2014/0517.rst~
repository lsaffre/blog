Bua, das war ein Akt!

One failure of the :ref:`welfare` test suite was due to the fact that
the Django's :manage:`test` command has a new way to discover test
cases. It took me some time to realize that I need indeed a
:mod:`lino_welfare.projects` package to manage all those sets of
settings.

Moved and renamed many files. Some examples::

=============================== =======================================
`lino_welfare.settings.eupen`   `lino_welfare.projects.eupen.settings`
`lino_welfare.settings.base`    `lino_welfare.projects.base`
=============================== =======================================
