Date and time fields in :mod:`lino.modlib.export_excel`
=======================================================

(Continued from :doc:`yesterday <1023>`.)

The new test case :ref:`lino.tested.export_excel` did *not* yet cover
the actual problem. Now it also tests the cell values of the generated
file.

While testing this I saw that `time` values could be handled the same
way and added them.  I also moved the variables `date_style`: instead
of instantiating them for every column, I defined them as class
variables.

Tested :ref:`cosi`
------------------

I had a tour on :ref:`cosi` in order to check whether recent changes
had affected the printing of invoices there.

Fixed a bug which caused the combobox on
:attr:`ml.ledger.Journal.template` to remain empty.

TODO: add the :mod:`lino.modlib.notes` module to :ref:`cosi` and add a
possibility to write payment reminders.

Continued on :srcref:`docs/tickets/136`
---------------------------------------

Until now I had the following template code (in
:xfile:`presence_certificate.body.html`)::

  {% set times = (dd.strftime(obj.waiting_since),
  dd.strftime(obj.gone_since)) %}

Changed this to::

  {% set times = (dd.strftime(obj.waiting_since),
  dd.strftime(obj.gone_since or this.time)) %}

And added a new property :attr:`lino.modlib.excerpts.Excerpt.time`.
