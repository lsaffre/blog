======================

I understood something: `isib.Contract`, `debts.Budet` and
`notes.Note` should no longer be (directly) printables, but become
attestables.

But I want to avoid manual changes in the two templates used to print
isip.Contract and jobs.Contract. By overriding their
get_printable_context mthod.
