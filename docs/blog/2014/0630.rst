Cool! I finished :srcref:`docs/tickets/113`. The last point is solved:

- Lino does not show the detail window on the created invoice

This was more subtle because it required a change in `linoweb.js` and
the internal web API: in order to test whether the calling window can
display a data_record or not, the action result now contains a
`detail_handler_name` rather than an `actor_url`.


Okay, but before I can ask Steve and Ãœlle to test this, here is
already a next problem: :srcref:`docs/tickets/114`.

And another one: :srcref:`docs/tickets/115`

And a third one: :srcref:`docs/tickets/116`.
