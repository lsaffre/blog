==========================

Added two  boolean fields `print_directly` and `signed_by_primary_coach`
to `aids.ConfirmationType`.

Added a `print_directly` boolean to `excerpts.ExcerptType`.  Default
value is True.  If this is unchecked, CreateExcerpt shows the created
excerpt instead of printing it directly and showing the result. This
is useful when the user wants a possibility to edit recipient and
language.

The detail_layout of an Excerpt now has a window_size (is no longer
fullscreen), and I removed the preview field. Because that seems more
natural.

Added new fields `doctor` and `doctor_type` to `RefundConfirmation`.

TODO:

- Deleting a database object should automatically delete all
  Controllable objects controlled by this.  For example the excerpts of
  a confirmation, the uploads of a client.
