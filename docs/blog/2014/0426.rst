Forwarding slave tables
-----------------------

:class:`lino.modlib.households.models.SiblingsByPerson` is like
:class:`lino.modlib.outbox.models.SentByPartner`.  

I'd suggest to call this usage pattern a "forwarding slave table".



Thoughs about :mod:`lino.modlib.households`.

Should there be a field `Househould.head`? Because in fact a
Household *must* have a "Head of household". This is a case for a
mandatory field (not nullable).

On the other hand the head of a household is also a member.  We want a
table `households.MembersByPerson`, and that table should show all
households of that person.

Can a person be member of more than one households *at a given time*?
This is technically possible, but it should lead to a plausibility
warning.

The role of a membership: should this be a database model or a
choicelist?

Visibility of actions
---------------------

- Some actions have a "hard-coded default implementation" and are
  rendered automatically: ShowDetail, InsertRow, DeleteRow, ...
- Custom actions (including many library actions like "Print",
  "Duplicate" etc) can be asked to show up at different places.

I updated the docstrings of
:attr:`custom_handler <lino.core.actions.Action.custom_handler>`,
:attr:`show_in_bbar <lino.core.actions.Action.show_in_bbar>`
and
:attr:`show_in_workflow <lino.core.actions.Action.show_in_workflow>`
