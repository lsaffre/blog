I have still some questions to meditate.

For the end-user there are two types of excerpts: (1) those who were
until now a simple "Print" button (usually together with a "Clear
Cache" button) and (2) those where the user chooses the "excerpt type"
before printing (e.g. on a Client).

For example in :ref:`welfare` a Budget or a Contract has zero or one
"printout". They either have been printed, or they haven't. But
there's never more than one printout per Budget or Contract.

Excerpts make it possible to dynamically configure this choice
between (1) and (2).  A concrete use case that drops into mind:
Invoices (in an accountance application) are usually case (1), but a
customer might decide that they want every invoice printed (possibly)
twice, one "internal" version (used e.g. by the packaging team) and
one version for the client. That would be case (2).

With case (1), users just want their "Print" and "Clear cache" buttons.
With case (2) it gets more complex.

So for Budgets and Contracts there will be no visible difference for
the user. The advantage of using excerpts is that now these printouts
are visible in the "history" (per client or per user).

Lino is flexible enough to manage all this, except for one thing:
:doc:`/tickets/105`.  As long as Lino cannot put a :term:`dialog
action` in the toolbar, the user interface changes rather much between
these two cases.
