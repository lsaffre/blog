I am now a fellow
-----------------

Last week I did something which I had been thinking of for a long 
time: I registered as a "fellowship" member of the 
`Free Software Foundation Europe <http://www.fsfe.org>`_.

If in the future I should happen to restart blogging about things that
are not directly related to Lino, then it will be in `Luc's blog
<http://blogs.fsfe.org/luc.saffre/>`_.


Upgraded demo sites on :ref:`lf`
--------------------------------

Between 16.20 and 16.30 the demo databases on :ref:`lf` were down
because I did a ``git pull`` and a :manage:`initdb_demo`.

Note that I did this in the Tallinn airport while waiting for my plane
to Brussels, because a second :ref:`ise` had come in.  Somebody
obviously trying :ref:`cosi`. Now it works.
