===================================

Started new project https://github.com/lsaffre/dblog for Mahmoud. It
is the first time that I invite somebody else to use this blogging
system.

Which caused a change in :mod:`atelier`:

:ref:`fab_commands` can now be invoked from a subdirectory of the
project's root. And :mod:`atelier.projects` now supports to work in
undeclared projects even if there is a :xfile:`config.py` file.

Drawback of this change is that the API for `setup_from_project` has
changed. Which is not a big problem since I am currently the only
known user of this system.  I had to change all my :xfile:`fabfile.py`
files, replacing::

  setup_from_project(...)

with::

  setup_from_fabfile(globals(), ...)
