Morning
-------

The default value for the `show_appointments` parameter of
:class:`ml.cal.EventsByDay` is now again "Yes".

Added a new :xfile:`fabfile.py` configuration option
`apidoc_exclude_pathnames`.  And then use it in Lino's
:file:`fabfile.py` to exclude the :file:`projects` directory.  A
disadvantage of Django is that you cannot generate Sphinx
documentation for multiple projects during a same Python process.

Lino Welfare "à la Châtelet"
(:mod:`lino_welfare.projects.chatelet.modlib.courses`) now adds two new
states "Started" and "Finished" to `EnrolmentStates`.  This is an
example of how to extend a ChoiceList.


Evening
-------

Fixed a bug which caused an AttributeError "'State' object has no
attribute 'uses_a_place'".
