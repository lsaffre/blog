========================

Continued with :srcref:`docs/tickets/123`. 

In a first version 

- I don't yet put separate tables for trips/journeys and
  courses. journeys are currently just "a special kind of courses":
  they don't have a room specified and thus don't generate any events.
- Enrolment options are implemented as products.
  Only one possible option per enrolment.
