======================

I understood something: `isip.Contract`, `debts.Budet` and
`notes.Note` should no longer be (direct) *printables*, but become
*attestables*.

But I am myself not yet 100% sure.  So I want to avoid manual changes
in the two templates used to print `isip.Contract` and
`jobs.Contract`. By overriding their `get_printable_context` method.


And I must change the current template naming strategy.
The `lino_welfare/config/attestations/Attestation` directory is okay
for general templates like `base.body.html` and 
`default.body.html`,
`certificate.body.html`,
but e.g. `cal_Guest.body.html` should be
`cal/Guest/presence_cert.body.html`
