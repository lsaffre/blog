Adding tags to my blog
----------------------

These last days I have been thinking and experimenting on the 
question :srcref:`docs/tickets/88`:
Nikola, Fiddling with my own Sphinx extensions, identi.ca, Wordpress.

Probably the important thing missing on my current documentation and
bloging system is a possibility to "tag" entries (or alternatively to
print a list of articles that refer to a given place).

Now I discovered `sphinxcontrib-taglist
<https://github.com/spinus/sphinxcontrib-taglist>`_,
which seems to be the solution.

Hm, but I cannot figure out how to get this working.  I tried the
following:

- inserted some tags to the present page using either the
  :rst:role:`tag` role (lets insert `blog` and `docs` for this page)
  or the :rst:dir:`tag` directive.

- I created a new page `/docs/ref/tags.rst` with a :rst:dir:`taglist`
  directive.

The tags are nicely formatted as tags should be, but they are not
clickable, and the `/ref/tags` page does not give a list of tagged
entries.

Tried cloning from Github and using the development version 
instead of the released version. No difference.
Sent a mail to the author.


:mod:`atelier.fablib`: The :cmd:`fab blog` command now also works in
docs-only projects like `llb` which have no Python code at all.
