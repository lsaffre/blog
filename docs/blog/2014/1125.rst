==========================

Theresia (the reception clerk in the demo databases of :ref:`welfare`)
did not have permission to see a client's detail.  Current solution is
to give view permission on `pcsw.Clients` to everybody.


Moved the registration of change watchers from 
:mod:`lino_welfare.models` 
to
a :meth:`lino.core.site.Site.startup` method
in :class:`lino_welfare.projects.eupen.settings.Site`.
Because :ref:`welcht` don't need it.
