=======================

I upgraded :ref:`eiche`, the last production site which was still
running with a version from before April 2014.


:class:`welfare.aids.Aid` is no longer called "Aid" but "Aid
confirmation".  It no longer inherits from
:class:`ml.boards.BoardDecision` (which removes the fields `board` and
`decided_date`).  Added new field `remark`. Adapted the default body
template used to print an excerpt for an aid confirmation.  Increased
application version from 1.1.13 to 1.1.14 since we need a database
migration. Wrote
:meth:`lino_welfare.migrate.Migrator.migrate_from_1_1_14`.

I saw only now that test :ref:`welfare` test suite is broken due to a
"UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xe9' in
position 70: ordinal not in range(128)" due to the recent changes in
:mod:`ml.beid`. Before fixing this I wait for more test results from
:ref:`welcht`.
