How to open a pull request
--------------------------

Manuel might add me as a contributor (how to do that? i didn't see any
obvious method in the web interface), but in our case it seems more
appropriate that Manuel ramains the project manager and I simply open
a pull request.

The GitHub docs say: Before you can open a pull request, you must
create a branch in your local repository, commit to it, and push the
branch to a repository or fork on GitHub.  (`Creating a pull request
<https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request>`__)

Okay, but how to create a branch from local changes on master?

A Spanish stackoverflow user asked the same 3 years ago: `Create a
branch from unstaged/uncommited changes on master
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2569459/git-create-a-branch-from-unstaged-uncommited-changes-on-master>`_

So I did::

    $ go sunto
    $ git checkout -b image_toolbar
    $ git commit -a -m "modified models"
    $ git status
    # On branch image_toolbar
    nothing to commit, working directory clean
    $ git diff master

Until here everything seems okay. 

But wen I try to push this, I get::

    $ git push

    ERROR: Permission to ManuelWeidmann/lino-sunto.git denied to lsaffre.
    fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

    Please make sure you have the correct access rights
    and the repository exists.


Testing event generation for courses
------------------------------------

Roger reported that there seem to be bugs in how :ref:`faggio` 
generates events for a given course.
And yes, of course this is a complex subject.

That's why I started to write a test suite in 
:ref:`faggio.tested.courses`.

Code changes:

- New setting :setting:`cal.debug_event_generator`.
