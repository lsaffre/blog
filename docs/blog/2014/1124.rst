Uff, I got the test welfare suite repaired.

:cmd:`fab api` in welfare revealed a subtle problem: Sphinx could not
build API docs for :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.polls` because no `polls`
plugin was installed for the :mod:`lino_welfare.projects.docs`.

:ref:`gx` introduced new ticket :ticket:`14`.  This is rather urgent
since they would then start to test the eidreader on their hardware.

- New configuration attribute
  :attr:`lino.modlib.beid.Plugin.read_only_simulate`.
