=========================

I started to use PyCharm. 
Together with :ref:`mw` we experimented with the Git integration.

After several hours I abandoned PyCharm once more and switched back to
:ref:`fab_commands` and Emacs.  This is not a definitive decision.  I
would probably find solutions to my beginner's problems if I would
invest more time into it.  Opened ticket :srcref:`docs/tickets/137`.
Worked on my :doc:`/dev/git`.
