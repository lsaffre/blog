Sharif and I had two Jitsi sessions where we continued to work on the Webshop
project.

TODO:

- Rename the webshop plugin to "shopping"

- Start an application "Lino Webshop". Remove the "shopping" plugin from Cos√¨.

- One or several new plugins: "extended products" (or simply "categories"),
  filtering criteria, campaigns, product ratings, topics ("departments"),
  brands, materials, price ranges, weight and size information for packaging and
  delivery management.

- Test suite and documentation

- Introduce "Payment drivers" and "Delivery drivers" (choicelists)
