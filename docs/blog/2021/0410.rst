The Mystery of the failing Welfare test suite (continued)
=========================================================


Saturday, April 10, 2021. Continued from :doc:`0409`.

This morning I discovered that my observations yesterday about wrong ordering
came because I had a bug in my new version of the
:func:`lino_welfare.modlib.welfare.models.customize_sqlite` function: it mixed
up -1 and 1.  That's the explanation for the mysterious observations I saw
yesterday.

I wrote a new doctest :file:`docs/specs/topics/sorting.rst` (rendered
:ref:`welfare.specs.topics.sorting`) in order to verify my theory that the
issues are caused by demo data being generated differently because sorting
behaviour has changed.  And the result is *negative*, i.e. my theory seems
wrong. This file passes always, even with the pypi versions of lino, xl, welfare
and weleup.

Right now I have no idea what else might be the reason.

When run with Django 3.1.8 and Lino master, :cmd:`inv prep test` in welfare
yields 2 failures, one being caused because django.db.models.fields.AutoField
changed to django.db.models.fields.BigAutoField, the other is the total number
of cal.Event objects, where the :file:`docs/specs/weleup/eupen.rst` expects 311
but gets 588.  This failure might have been there for some time, there is indeed

I now added :func:`show_db_overview` to :file:`docs/specs/weleup/eupen.rst`.
