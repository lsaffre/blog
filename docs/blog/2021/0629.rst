Lino Medico
===========

Sharif and I had a brainstorming for a new Lino, Lino Medico, that might be
useful in Bangladesh where there is no national health insurance system.

Inspiration from Estonia:

- https://haigekassa.ee/en/people/my-data-and-e-services
- https://www.digilugu.ee

Concepts that might be useful in :ref:`medico`

- calendar : National eBooking system : Booking, changing and cancelling the specialist visit time
- personal medical history
- medical data the health care service providers have submitted about you.
- incapacity certificates
- physician
- prescriptions for pharmaceuticals
- prescriptions for medical devices

Existing plugins that might be useful:

- cal, calview
- contacts : physicians and patients
- clients
- products (pharmaceuticals)
- tickets, comments : patient history
- courses (therapies)
