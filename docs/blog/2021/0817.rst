========================

I reviewed the user guide about :ref:`ug.howto.purchases` and slightly optimized
the behaviour when entering partly deducible VAT: when you manually change the
:attr:`vat_class` of an invoice item, then Lino now re-computes all amounts of
that item, based on the invoices total amount and the new :term:`VAT class`.


There was no insert_layout in :class:`sheet.Items`, making it impossible to
create a new item using the :kbd:`Insert` key.

Renamed :term:`VAT class` "Operations without VAT" to "Without VAT". And the
translations for de and fr were missing.
