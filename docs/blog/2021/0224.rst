Who can see the detail of an activity
=====================================

Yesterday I was interrupted by Johanna who reported a little regression in
:ref:`avanti` after their update last week: :ticket:`3986`. The detail link in
:class:`lino_xl.lib.courses.MyCoursesGiven` didn't work any more for teachers.

This caused me several hours of diving. As a result we have a new method
:meth:`get_request_detail_action
<lino.core.actors.Actor.get_request_detail_action>`. I covered the case in a
:term:`tested document`:  :ref:`avanti.specs.get_request_detail_action`.
