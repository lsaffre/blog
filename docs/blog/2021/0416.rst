======================

I finished :doc:`0415` and pushed my work to master. Actually there are still
minor things to fix, but I can do this sporadically now.  This was for me a week
in what I would call the *Maigret mode*.  It's a mode of working that makes
sense only with free software.

Today I learned that Tuxedo recommend to `not upgrade Ubuntu
<https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/de/Infos/Hilfe-Support/Anleitungen/Ubuntu-Upgrade-von-18-04-auf-20-04.tuxedo>`__
from 18.04 to 20.04 on their computers. Wow. That was unexpected. It's the
explanation for the message I have been getting each time I tried to upgrade:

  Could not calculate the upgrade. An unresolvable problem occurred while
  calculating the upgrade. This was likely caused by: Unofficial software packages
  not provided by Ubuntu. Please use the tool 'ppa-purge' from the ppa-purge
  package to remove software from a Launchpad PPA and try the upgrade again.

Actually that's okay for me.
