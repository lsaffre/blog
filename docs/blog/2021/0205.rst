How to convert from unipath to pathlib
=======================================

- AttributeError: 'PosixPath' object has no attribute 'child'

  ``pth.child(x)`` --> ``pth / x``

- AttributeError: 'PosixPath' object has no attribute 'write_file'

  ``pth.write_file(x)`` --> ``pth.write_text(x)``

- AttributeError: 'PosixPath' object has no attribute 'lower'

  ``pth.lower(x)`` --> ``str(pth).lower(x)``

  In general, :class:`unipath.Path` objects had the feature (or the non-feature)
  to behave like strings.
