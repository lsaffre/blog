The docs about Lino Tera were still missing after the fire at OVH. Now I
restored them, but they are multilingual (en, de), and I did not want to have
the German docs under their own domain name. Now they are using the same method
as for www.saffre-rumma.net, where the `German
<https://tera.lino-framework.org/de>`__ doctree is just a subdirectory of the
`English one <https://tera.lino-framework.org>`__.

Testing whether intersphinx_urls work: :ref:`tera` and :ref:`tera.de`.

Tera wasn't the only project with URL problems. Several other projects were not
yet being served on LF. For some other projects, e.g. presto, I decided to not
serve the presto docs (because I didn't want to add yet another subdomain on LF
for a project that doesn't yet have impressive docs) on LF and to do it as with
shop and mentori: have them hosted only on GitLab pages. Same for react. That's
why I also moved these repositories from GitHub to GitLab. And two others as
well. Contributors must update the remotes of their clones, as explained in
:ref:`gh2gl`.

presto is the first project with multilingual docs that is rendered only on
GitLab pages.
