The :class:`lino_xl.lib.orders.InvoicesByOrder`. now uses
:meth:`lino_xl.lib.invoicing.InvoiceGenerator.get_invoiceable_partner`. We want
this table to show all invoices having the same invoice recipient as this
current order. Until now it was used only in :ref:`presto` where the
:attr:`lino.core.site.Site.project_model` is a subclass of
:class:`lino_xl.lib.contacts.Partner`. But in :ref:`noi` it's different.
