Yesterday, after several days of trying to understand why my changes for
:ticket:`3301` broke Presto, I explained the situation to Sharif, and then
finally understood the last missing piece and got :ref:`presto` fixed. Thanks to
Sharif for listening.

Now I committed and started to review the docs:
:ref:`xl.specs.invoicing`
:ref:`ug.plugins.invoicing`
:ref:`ug.plugins.orders`

TODO: Manual tests in Noi. Make a template for printing an SLA. Write more docs.
