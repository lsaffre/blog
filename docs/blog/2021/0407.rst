========================

I did a series of changes in the whole documentation system. We are moving
towards a new feature I'd call "Shared Sphinx configurations".  The idea was
triggered by :ticket:`4085` (A common Sphinx config for non-tech docs like cg,
hg and sr), which was triggered by :ticket:`4079` (Move Hosting Guide section
from book to a separate doctree).  The basic problem is that we have a lot of
Sphinx :xfile:`conf.py` files and most of them contain redundant information.
And because things evolve over the years, they are quite a mess. For example the
:rst:role:`ticket` role (used to render for example :ticket:`4085`) was pointing
to a wrong URL in most doctrees. :func:`atelier.sphinxconf.configure` or its
child :func:`lino.sphinxcontrib.configure` now set reasonable default values for
`intersphinx_mapping` and `extlinks`. It is now a bit less messy and works for
me, but before writing documentation about it, it needs more work.

I removed a few redundant settings for which the default value is given by
atelier: master_doc, source_suffix, primary_domain
