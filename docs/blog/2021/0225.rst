Contributors in Noi
===================

We have a new volunteer contributor in Bangladesh.   I fixed a series of little
problems in :ref:`noi`.

Users of type :attr:`lino_noi.lib.noi.UserTypes.contributor` don't want to see
certain data, e.g. our contacts, or the tickets of teams where he is not member.
Also e.g. the :class:`lino_xl.lib.groups.Groups` table should be viewable only
to the :term:`site administrator`.

In :mod:`lino_book.projects.noi1e`, when signing in as mathieu (a contributor)
you saw a welcome message that said you were working on ticket #1, but when
clicking on the ticket it turned out that you had no permission to see that
ticket. This was actually just because the :fixture:`demo` fixture for
:mod:`lino_book.projects.noi1e` created :class:`working.Session` objects without
checking whether the worker is a member of the team (given by the site of the
ticket). I changed this demo fixture, which caused of course some doctests to
fail because the ticket distribution has changed. And I adapted them.

The welcome messages of type "<worker> is working on <ticket>" (generated by
:func:`lino_xl.lib.working.models.welcome_messages`) was always showing all workers.
Which potentially caused link to a ticket that mathieu had no permission to see.
But for a contributor it should show only sessions in teams the contributor belons to.

I removed the ContactsUser role from
:attr:`lino_noi.lib.noi.UserTypes.contributor`.
