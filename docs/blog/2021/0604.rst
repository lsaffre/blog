review the quicklink api for dashboard
======================================

This was yet another avalanche of long-awaited code cleanup.

This change in the quicklink definition API was needed because the new
DashboardLayouts need a static list of the quicklinks, i.e. which does not
depend on the user type. Only when rendering them, Lino checks for view
permission. Because the new Dashboard is an actor, and the Site's quicklinks are
in the toolbar of this actor.

.. currentmodule:: lino.core.site

New property :attr:`Site.quicklinks`.
New method :meth:`Site.get_quicklink_items`.

Methods :meth:`Site.setup_quicklinks` and :meth:`Site.get_quicklinks` have a
changed API.

.. currentmodule:: lino.core.plugin

Also :meth:`Plugin.get_quicklinks` and :meth:`Plugin.setup_quicklinks`.
