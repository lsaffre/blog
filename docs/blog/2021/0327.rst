The :ref:`lino.specs.export_excel` doctest revealed that
:attr:`lino.mixins.human.Human.age` is a virtual field that should have the
:attr:`lino.core.fields.VirtualField.wildcard_data_elem` attribute set to
`True`.  And then there was a bug: virtualfields didn't inherit that attribute
from their :attr:`return_type`.

I merged the changelogs from weleup and welcht to those of welfare. ATM I think
that welfare should keep its own changelog (:ref:`welfare.changes`), which is
separated from our main changelog (:ref:`book.changes`).

The :term:`privileged applications` (cosi, noi, voga, ...), i.e. the ones that
are an integral part of the Lino test suite because they have their API
documentation and tested docs in the book.
