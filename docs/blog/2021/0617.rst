An overview of existing Lino applications
=========================================

Here is my plan for the demo session for Natasa.

I switched mathieu and avanti1 to demo_date 20210617 and ran pm prep. In mathieu
this caused a unique constraint failure, so I optimized
:meth:`welfare.modlib.isip.ContractBase.suggest_cal_guests` to remove duplicate
partners from its suggestions.

In mathieu I also changed :attr:`languages` to "en fr de nl".

mathieu (:ref:`welfare`)

- Sign in as theresia (reception clerk) and receive a client,
  e.g. Guido Radermacher.
- Sign in as a social worker and meet the client
- workshops and enrolments
- aids and aids confirmations

avanti1 (ref:`avanti`)

- Sign in as robin. Show alphabetization course.
  Try to mark the lesson 11.06.2021 as took place. Lino refuses.
- Sign in as laura and mark the participants of 11.06.2021 as present.

roger (ref:`voga`)
