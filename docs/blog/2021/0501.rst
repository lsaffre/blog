More optimizations in the documentation framework
=================================================

:ticket:`4139` (Remove need to define srcref_url) --
The ``srcref_url`` setting is no longer needed. The :func:`rstgen.srcref`
function (the only function that was readit it) now looks whether
``SETUP_INFO['url']`` exists and assumes that it contains the URL of the source
code repository.

:func:`rstgen.srcref` is used e.g. in :mod:`atelier.sphinxconf.base` to add a
link to the source code in the autodoc API docs.  Or by the :rst:role:`srcref`
role (which is implemented using :mod:`sphinx.ext.extlinks`). Or by the
:ref:`memo.py` memo command.

Fixed a bug: :func:`get_lang_selector` didn't work when :envvar:`use_dirhtml`
was `False`.

The :xfile:`setup_info.py` file can now contain another dict ``ATELIER_INFO`` to
contain the project configuration settings. Experimental. Used in :ref:`cosi`.
