:cmd:`pm prep` in :mod:`lino_book.projects.lydia` demo project (Tera) gives
"AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'main'". I don't yet understand
why this happened now, but anyway :meth:`set_detail_layout` is no longer needed
in this case because we can now override a :term:`detail layout` by using a
class already in the beginning.

Miscellaneous changes:

- ledger.MyMovements

- :manage:`makehelp`

- atelier: It is now possible to instantiate a :class:`atelier.projects.Project`
  for a root directory that contains neither a :xfile:`tasks.py` nor a
  :xfile:`setup.py` file. The :manage:`makehelp`
