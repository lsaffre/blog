======================

I found yet another missing piece: we must differentiate between the Community
Guide (cg) and the User Guide (ug). I now created the latter.
It is hosted on https://using.lino-framework.org and the
source code is on https://gitlab.com/lino-framework/ug.

The :ref:`ug.specs` section has already four chapters!  And I didn't write these
now, I copied them from :ref:`book.specs` and then removed on both sides the
partns that were at the wrong place.  I have the impression that everything is
much more readable now.  My first steps seem to confirm this move.

The :ref:`cg` and the :ref:`ug` are similar in that they both are docs-only
repositories (they don't define any Python package) and are translated. They
differ because of the target audience: :ref:`cg` is for people who do not yet
use Lino (future :term:`site operators <site operator>`, :term:`hosting
providers <hosting provider>` or :term:`application developers <application
developer>`) while the :ref:`ug` is for :term:`end users <end user>` needing
help.


Where to put the parameter panel
================================

In ExtJS the parameter panel is an "inline" panel that is "docked" into the
window together with the main element. The end user can then expand or collapse
it.  In React it was a popup window.  That was also nice.

We added a new Actor attribute
:attr:`lino.core.actors.Actor.params_panel_pos`.
