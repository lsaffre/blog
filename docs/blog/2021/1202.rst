I started to review the docs about :term:`ElasticSearch` in book and hg. Not
finished because I was distracted by another issue: The latest Sphinx versions
are more strict regarding duplicate definitions, which is good, but I had a few
of them and needed to dive into the docs in order to decide how to resolve them.

I can now refer to :setting:`use_elasticsearch` and
:setting:`search.elasticsearch_url`, which refers to the new "Local settings
reference" page (:ref:`hg.ref.settings`) in the :ref:`hg`.

I also started to boldly edit Sharif's first drafts in :ref:`dg.plugins.search`.
