.. currentmodule:: lino.modlib.uploads

To test the new data checkers :class:`UploadChecker` and
:class:`UploadsFolderChecker`,  I needed to write a test case that uploads some
files.

I did not do this using Django test client (which might also be interesting and
is explained `here
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/topics/testing/tools/#django.test.Client.post>`__)
but by extending the demo fixtures:  :fixture:`demo_bookings` now adds
:term:`upload entries <upload entry>` with dummy pdf files for purchase
invoices, and :fixture:`demo3` (in uploads) deletes one of these files
(simulating the case where it has actually got lost) and adds an orphaned file
to the uploads folder.
