=====================

I eliminated a pseudo-feature of
:func:`rstgen.sphinxconf.interproject.configure` : calling it without
specifying a list of projects to include (the ``prjspec`` argument) was adding
all local atelier projects. I created this feature for generating my blog. But
now I removed the feature and added explicit intersphinx dependencies to my
blog's :xfile:`conf.py` instead.
