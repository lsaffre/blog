.. _corsa:

Lino Corsa
==========

I started the :ref:`corsa` project, an application for managing races, i.e.
sport events where people compete against each other in order to see who's the
best.

This was my first usage of the :cmd:`getlino startproject`.

Go to your projects root directory::

  $ cd ~/projects

Run :cmd:`getlino startproject`::

  $ getlino startproject -c corsa

Install the new Python package::

  $ pip install -e corsa/
  Obtaining file:///home/luc/work/corsa
  ...
  Installing collected packages: lino-corsa
    Running setup.py develop for lino-corsa
  Successfully installed lino-corsa-0.2.0

Add the project to your :xfile:`~/.atelier/config.py` file.

Decide whether you want to copy functionality from existing projects.

For example, we started :ref:`corsa` with a copy the ``courses`` plugin from
:ref:`voga`::

  $ cp -a ~/projects/voga/lino_voga/lib/courses lino_corsa/lib

And then manually edited the copied source code.

Edit the :xfile:`user_types.py` file of your new project.

In our example we add the following to our :xfile:`user_types.py` file::

  from lino_xl.lib.courses.roles import CoursesUser
  from lino.modlib.office.roles import OfficeUser

  class SiteUser(SiteUser, CoursesUser, OfficeUser):
      pass

  class SiteStaff(SiteStaff, CoursesUser, OfficeUser):
      pass

  class SiteAdmin(SiteAdmin, CoursesUser, OfficeUser):
      pass

Summary: we import the roles of the plugins, then tell Lino which user type
inherits from which role.

Go to the demo project::

  $ cd ~/projects/corsa/lino_corsa/projects/corsa1
  $ pm prep

If you changed anything, you are likely to get error messages here.
