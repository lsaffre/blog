=======================

I continued with my review of the "documentation network" (see :doc:`0426`).

Today's most visible result is a new documentation page :ref:`getlino.apps`,
which is automatically generated when I run :cmd:`inv bd` in the :ref:`cg`
because this repository uses the new :envvar:`make_docs_command` setting, which
calls the new command :cmd:`getlino list`.

I reviewed the `description`, `url`, `author` and `author_email` fields in all
:xfile:`setup_info.py` files.

In every repository I changed `author` to "Rumma & Ko Ltd" and `author_email` to
"info@lino-framework.org".

I have changes in almost 40 repositories. And tthey all have the same commit
message "https://luc.lino-framework.org/blog/2021/0427.html". (I don't recommend
my exotic practice of referring to a blog entry in a commit message... but today
I would have taken half an hour more for these commits without it).
