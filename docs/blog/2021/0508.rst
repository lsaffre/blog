Sharif and I have done two sessions for :ref:`shop`. It is advancing.  We
started with -probably- the last fundamental question: how to render products
for normal customers.  We tried using :mod:`lino.modlib.publisher` but this is
not what we need for webshop.

It's even possible that we will deprecate :mod:`lino.modlib.publisher`
altogether. Even in :mod:`lino_book.projects.cms` it yields poor results. Partly
because :mod:`lino_book.projects.cms` is just a submarine project and because it
is quite crazy to believe that a CMS in Lino has a chance on the market. But the
CMS project inn't dead, it's just sleeping. Maybe one day it will wake up with
:mod:`lino_xl.lib.albums` instead of  :mod:`lino.modlib.publisher`...   It was
broken for some trivial reason, and this wasn't covered by the test suite. I
added it to the :xfile:`test_demo.py` file.
