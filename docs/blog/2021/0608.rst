The UI issue (window doesn't close after POST) is fixed, but the MySQL
connection still gets lost after a POST. IOW I can submit a first comment, but
the second comment receives an empty response to the POST request.

Here is a second comment just to test whether submitting an insert window still
causes the MySQL connection to get lost.
