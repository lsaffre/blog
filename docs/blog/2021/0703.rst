Medico:

one new concept will be "availabilities".

Every Physician configures a list of availabilities: "I am available on Mondays
and Wednesdays from 8 to 12 in hospital X room Y".  And then the every physician
has a system of "time slots" where they can accept appointments. Lino uses this
table to generate suggested calendar entries.  Availability inherits from
cal.EventGenerator.

We will need to extend EventGenerator because atm it supports only one calendar
entry per day.

A patient says "I need to see a cardiologist". Lino would show a list of
available calendar events that do not yet have a guest (more precisely which are
in state "Available").

We also need the receeption plugin
