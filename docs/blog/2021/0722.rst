Changes in the :mod:`lino_xl.lib.invoicing` model.

.. currentmodule:: lino_xl.lib.invoicing

To :attr:`Plan.today` field of an :term:`invoicing plan` is now read-only.
That's because Lino needs it to make sure that the database never contains more
than one :term:`invoicing plan` per user.

New plugin attribute :attr:`Plugin.order_model` is "orders.Order" for
:ref:`presto`.  Until now we had some special logic for orders in presto. But
this special logic is actually generic (and optional): we need it in noi as
well.

I converted docs about :mod:`lino_voga.lib.courses` to prosa.

I started to review the docs about :mod:`lino_xl.lib.invoicing`.  Until now we
had no difference between :term:`invoice generator` and :term:`invoiceable`, but
maybe we want to separate them.

TODO:

Extend the :mod:`lino_xl.lib.orders` plugin: an order is not only an
EventGenerator but also an InvoiceGenerator.
