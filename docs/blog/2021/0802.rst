======================

I committed about 2 weeks of work on :ticket:`3301`. The main changes are in
:mod:`lino_xl.lib.invoicing` and :mod:`lino_xl.lib.orders` (both :ref:`xl`) and
the first user is :ref:`noi` where we can now write service level agreements
(periodic invoice generators), so that we can use Lino to write our yearly
invoices.

TODO: :ref:`presto` is still broken. Manual tests in Noi. Make a template for
printing an SLA. Write more docs.


Intermezzo: Oops, there is a little `problem on GitLab
<https://gitlab.com/lino-framework/book/-/jobs/1469319484>`___: already
:cmd:`inv prep` fails with :message:`undefined symbol:
pango_context_set_round_glyph_positions`. After doing :cmd:`pip install -U
weasyprint cffi` on my machine, I have it also here. Other people have `reported
and documented the issue <https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/issues/1384>`__:
Weasyprint 53 needs a newer version of Pango, which is not yet available on
stable debian. So as a works-for-me, I simply add "weasyprint<52" to Lino's
:envvar:`install_requires`.
