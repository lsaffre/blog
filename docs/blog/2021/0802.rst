I committed about 2 weeks of work on :ticket:`3031`. The main changes are in
:mod:`lino_xl.lib.invoicing` and :mod:`lino_xl.lib.orders` (both :ref:`xl`) and
the first user is :ref:`noi` where we can now write service level agreements
(periodic invoice generators), so that we can use Lino to write our yearly
invoices.

TODO: :ref:`presto` is still broken. Manual tests in Noi. Make a template for
printing an SLA. Write more docs.
