Today I worked on :ticket:`2406`. The :term:`periodic intra-community statement`
is the most important XML file to generate because this statement can contain
quite much data. Lino will also be able to generate the :term:`periodic VAT
declaration`, but that's less urgent because end users more easily agree to
manually enter a few numbers.

First thing was to move the XSD file for SEPA :term:`payment orders <payment
order>` from :mod:`etgen` to :mod:`lino_xl.lib.finan` and to generalize it.

The last thing for today is to design the queryset to be used in the
:term:`periodic intra-community statement`. Here is how far I got for now:
