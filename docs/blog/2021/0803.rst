Continued from :doc:`yesterday <0802>`.

Trying to understood why presto is still failing. It's because I tried to
optimize things regarding the differentiation between the "partner" and the
:term:`invoice recipient`. Seems that Presto is just the only demo having examples of
invoice recipients different from partner, and therefore the only use case where
this optimization caused a failure.

I tried to get rid of this difference,  but this means that the invoice
recipients always receive one invoice per partner, possibly having multiple
invoices sent by a single plan. We cannot remove the feature of group invoices.
For example an orphan house having 10 children attend to therapies, they want to
see the costs separated per child, but they do not want to get 10 invoices every
month.

TODO: :ref:`presto` is still broken. Manual tests in Noi. Make a template for
printing an SLA. Write more docs.
