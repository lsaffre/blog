Unified Sphinx theme for all websites of the Lino framework
===========================================================

I continued to work on :ticket:`4101`, which is actually just a part of
:ticket:`4085`. Calling :func:`lino.sphinxcontrib.configure` in a Sphinx
:xfile:`conf.py` file now uses the `insipid
<https://insipid-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io>`__ theme instead of the
`pydata_sphinx_theme <https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io>`__.


Move from GitHub to GitLab
==========================

Here is my cheat sheet for moving the next repositories from GH to GL.

Change the remote and push to the new upstream::

  $ git remote rm origin
  $ git remote add origin git@gitlab.com:lino-framework/XXX.git
  $ git push -u git@gitlab.com:lino-framework/XXX.git master

Add a :xfile:`.gitlab-ci.yml` file (copy from a repo that is already on GL)::

  $ cp ../cosi/.gitlab-ci.yml .
  $ git add .gitlab-ci.yml

Update URLs in the :xfile:`setup_info.py`. Run :cmd:`inv bd` to update the
:xfile:`README.rst` file. Then push your first changes on GitLab::

  $ git ci -am "moved from GitHub to GitLab"
  $ git push

Visit the GitLab project page on https://gitlab.com/lino-framework and change
visibility from "private" to "public". (This can't be done using the CLI:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57395399/gitlab-default-project-visibility-when-creating-projects-from-terminal)


Go to https://github.com/lino-framework/XXX and use the GitHub web UI to  add a
warning to the README.rst file::

  Warning: This repository has moved to https://gitlab.com/lino-framework/XXX

And then tell GitLab to archive the repository.

Finally:

- Update the known repositories in :mod:`getlino.utils`.
- Run :cmd:`pp -l` and check the project urls.
- Release to PyPI.


Done for the following repositories: lino, xl, noi, cosi, voga, avanti, welfare, weleup, welcht
