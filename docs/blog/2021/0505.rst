======================

I worked several hours in the :ref:`cg`. I am still not satisfied but it's
getting better.

The term *Lino developer* is too general.
It's better to say
:term:`application developer`, :term:`contributing developer` or
:term:`core developer`.

Note that :term:`core developer` doesn't mean somebody who cares only about the
:term:`Lino core`.

I replaced all occurrences of "site administrator" by :term:`site manager`.

For the first time in my life I did a mass commit::

  $ pp -d git ci -am "replace github by gitlab in requirements.txt"
  Successfully terminated `git ci -am replace github by gitlab in requirements.txt` for all projects

(This was after https://gitlab.com/lino-framework/shop/-/jobs/1236797299)

The :cmd:`doctest docs/dev/redirect.rst` in :ref:`book` is currently failing
because Hannes is working on the redirect (:ticket:`4133`). This test as such is
a good thing, but it is at the wrong place. It should not be part of the
``book`` project. The book shouldn't break just because one of our URLs is
broken.  It is a form of monitoring and should run more often, and it should
notify a list of responsible administrators.  Is this a job for Ansible?
