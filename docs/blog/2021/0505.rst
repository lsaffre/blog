I worked several hours in the :ref:`cg`. I am still not satisfied but it's
getting better.

The term *Lino developer* is too general.
It's better to say
:term:`application developer`, :term:`contributing developer` or
:term:`core developer`.

Note that :term:`core developer` doesn't mean somebody who cares only about the
:term:`Lino core`.

I replaced all occurrences of :term:`site administrator` by :term:`site
manager`.
