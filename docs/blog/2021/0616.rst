insipid ticket #50
==================

With Matthias' help I fixed `insipid ticket #50
<https://github.com/mgeier/insipid-sphinx-theme/issues/50>`__.


The request's session was deleted before the request completed
==============================================================

After clicking the submit button of the insert window of a comment (POST to
`/api/comments/CommentsByRFC`) I got once more a red notification message
(saying something I didn't manage to read).

The Lino log says::

In `this thread on stackoverflow
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46982576/the-requests-session-was-deleted-before-the-request-completed-the-user-may-hav>`__
they suggest miscellaneous explanations, but none of them seems to apply here.
Jane uses the database for storing sessions, and I am quite sure that I didn't
log out in some other tab.

>>> from django.conf import settings
>>> settings.SESSION_ENGINE
'django.contrib.sessions.backends.db'

Actually the first problem in above traceback is `DatabaseError: Forced update
did not affect any rows`, when something tries to save the current session.

The following line of the traceback looks interesting::

    File ".../python3.7/site-packages/django/utils/deprecation.py", line 119, in __call__
      response = self.process_response(request, response)

That code uses asyncio, so I wonder whether the problems might come because the
notify plugin uses `asgiref.sync.async_to_sync`. But hasn't it been doing that
already earlier? That question remains open for my next session.

I create a new comment "new comment for testing" and click "Create". Sometimes
it works and sometimes it doesn't work. When it doesn't work, then it actually
did create the comment, but

The problem seems to have disappeared after setting
:attr:`lino.core.site.Site.use_multiprocessing` to `False`.


Just as a reminder, here are the new features Lino on which we are working

- push api
- use multiprocessing when notifying others
- dashboard layouts
- delayed values
- sync google api for calendar and contacts
- optimizations of react front end
