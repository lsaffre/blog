Online registration for Lino Shop
=================================

This week-end I worked, partly with Sharif, on :ticket:`4143` (Review handling
of the User.partner field), which was triggered by :ticket:`4121`, which we need
for :ref:`shop`. But it is about :term:`online registration`, a general feature
on which we had previously done some work, which went to sleep with the
:ref:`care` project. Now is the moment to wake it up. I also did :ticket:`2049`
(Users don't need to be partners in Noi) because it is part of the problem. I am
now sure that we want to get rid of :mod:`lino_xl.lib.online.users`.

.. currentmodule:: lino.modlib.users

I moved some functionality from :mod:`lino_xl.lib.online.users` to
:mod:`lino.modlib.users`:

- New plugin option :data:`use_verify` and :attr:`User.verify` action.
- The `submit_insert` action now always does a nice warning when a username is already taken.
- The :attr:`User.send_welcome_email` action is no longer a window action. We
  don't want any question about recipient or subject of the mail.

When the :attr:`User.partner` field is empty, and all three fields first_name,
last_name and email are non-empty, (and if the user is verified on a site with
:data:`use_verify` set to True), then Lino now automatically creates a
`contacts.Person` based on this data. This automatism does not apply to
SiteAdmin users who can edit the partner field manually.

As a side effect I had to review :class:`lino_noi.lib.users.UserDetail`.

One advantage of not using  :mod:`lino_xl.lib.online.users` any more: In
:ref:`shop` we can have a same :term:`person` with two user accounts: one as a
:attr:`lino_shop.lib.shop.UserTypes.customer` and one as a
:attr:`lino_shop.lib.shop.UserTypes.vendor`.

These changes caused (trivial) failures in quite some doctest suites because we
have now one more view (about.DateFormats), one window action less and one more field in User.

Data migration will be funny: In noi we no longer use online.users: User is no
longer a subclass of Person. Might require some magic when migrating production
data.

New user role :class:`LedgerPartner`
====================================

.. currentmodule:: lino_xl.lib.ledger

In :mod:`lino_xl.lib.ledger` I added a new role :class:`LedgerPartner`, and
:attr:`lino_shop.lib.shop.UserTypes.customer` and
:attr:`lino_shop.lib.shop.UserTypes.vendor` already inherit from it. Next step
is to add :term:`table views <table view>` like  :class:`MyInvoices` and
:class:`MyPayments`


Configuring how to represent dates
==================================

I added a new field :attr:`User.date_format`. It is there for all applications.
It is not yet being used, but :mod:`lino_react` is ready to implement it. And
:mod:`lino.modlib.extjs` might follow one day.

The Hydra effect
================

Note: The Hydra effect is when you have the impression of not advancing. You cut
down one head of the monster and it grows seven new ones. But Lino is like a
Hydra, except that it gets more *beautiful* (not more dangerous) each time you
fix a bug.  Working on a beast like Lino makes sense only because it is free
software.

The documentation framework, even taken on its own, is a full-featured Hydra.
But is getting better with each iteration.  Now we have a page about it:
:ref:`lino.doctrees`.

Some bug in the React text editor
=================================

I created a comment and then pasted some text into it. This caused my browser
page to lock up. Firefox asked me "This page is slowing down your browser. Do
you want to stop it?"  After stopping it, I had the following messages in the JS console::

  Uncaught Error: An error was thrown inside one of your components, but React doesn't know what it was. This is likely due to browser flakiness. React does its best to preserve the "Pause on exceptions" behavior of the DevTools, which requires some DEV-mode only tricks. It's possible that these don't work in your browser. Try triggering the error in production mode, or switching to a modern browser. If you suspect that this is actually an issue with React, please file an issue.

But I was not yet able to systematically reproduce this problem. â€‹

Testing :term:`online registration`
===================================

For testing :term:`online registration` feature,  we now have a new function
:func:`lino.core.auth.utils.activate_social_auth_testing`. These "public
secrets" are used for testing social authentication on a localhost. Until now
they were available only in noi1e (and noi1r which imports the settings from
noi1e). But now they are used also for :mod:`lino_shop.projects.shop1`

I started to write some content for :ref:`shop.guide`.
