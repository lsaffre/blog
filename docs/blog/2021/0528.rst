====================

I "finished" the developer documentation about :ref:`book.specs.notify` and did
a last code change: renamed ``enable_push`` to :data:`use_push_api
<lino.modlib.notify.use_push_api>`.

Once more I gave in to the temptation of working a bit in the general
documentation and reorganized some pages in the :ref:`lf`, :ref:`cg`  and the
:ref:`ug`.

Sharif and I had a session where we started the :class:`OpenHelp
<lino.core.actions.OpenHelp>` action.  Every actor gets a "Help" button, which
opens a window on the :term:`site documentation` generated by
:manage:`makehelp`. The new button action appears already in the toolbar, but is
not yet clickable. We added a new method :meth:`Action.get_a_href_target`, which
is to be called by the renderer when rendering the JS cache files. It usually
returns `None`. When it returns a string, Lino should treat this string as a
constant URL to be opened in a new window instead of any other action. Sharif
will continue on this.

https://gitlab.com/lino-framework/cg/-/jobs/1299635109 : this failure (and
several others of this style) is because I forgot to add the static path to
atelier's :xfile:`MANIFESST.in`.

Atelier is now at version 1.1.38. It starts to sound ridiculous. We might change
from semantic versioning to the month-based versioning like for Lino.  There is
one thing that makes me hesitate: I have absolutely no idea why I would ever
want to use semantic versioning. That's suspicious.
