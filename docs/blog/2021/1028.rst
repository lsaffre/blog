Together on our way
==========================

Thursday, October 28, 2021

Congratulations to Hannes and Sharif: They managed to collaborate completely
without my help and get Jane back after an accident during Upgrade. This is an
important little success in the history of Lino: a :term:`application developer`
and a :term:`site maintainer` collaborating to maintain a :term:`Lino site`.
Lino is getting bigger than me.

This is just one of many small signs I see almost every day and which tell me:
we are on the right way. Lino is in a kind of cocoon state. This blog is getting
less used as I delegate coding to Sharif whenever possible and as Jane becomes
our main communication channel.  We are together on our way as a team. We are
ready for the next Lino project without being in a hurry. We use spare time for
doing creative research work.
