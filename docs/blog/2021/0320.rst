Sharif an I continued to work on the :mod:`lino_xl.lib.webshop` plugin and
committed our work.

TODO:

- Provide a payment method for paying via `bKash <https://www.bkash.com/>`__.

- Lino gives `update_widgets` as the `action_name` of the AddToCart action. It
  works because this name is used only in the AJAX requests, but it's not true.

- Remove the update_plan action from the mixin because at least webshop doesn't need it.
