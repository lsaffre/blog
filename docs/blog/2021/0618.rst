About data elements, atomizers & Co
===================================

.. glossary::

  actor handle

    An object in memory, one instance for each :term:`actor`, created lazily by
    calling :meth:`Actor.get_handle`.

  data store

    Responsible for mapping data exchanges between the Django ORM and the web
    front end.

    providing row2dict and row2list

    An object in memory, created at startup, assigned to each :term:`actor
    handle`.

    Has a list of :term:`store fields <store field>`. All store fields are in
    :attr:`list_fields`,  and it has several lists that contain their own
    "selection" of fields: :attr:`list_fields` (which we should rename to
    :attr:`grid_fields`), :attr:`detail_fields`, :attr:`card_fields` and
    :attr:`item_fields`.

  ah

    Common variable name for :term:`actor handle`.

  rh

    Common variable name for "report handle",  the ancient term for :term:`actor
    handle`.

  data element

    A named element of a layout

  store field

    The part of a data store that is responsible for one data element.

  atomizer

    Synonym of :term:`store field`.



  data view

    The new name I suggest to use instead of :term:`actor`.

    Describes a set of "data rows", "actions" and "layouts".

  choicelist of actors

    A recipe where the choices of a choicelist point to a data view



:attr:`Actor._handle_class`
:class:`TableHandle`

:meth:`get_handle_name` is still used in :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.debts`, where
we want to have different variants of table columns for a slave table. I wrote
this solution before I discovered the recipe for doing this using a choicelist
holding actors. We should replace this by a :term:`choicelist of actors`.
