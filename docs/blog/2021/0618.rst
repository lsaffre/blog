I started a topic page in the developer guide: :ref:`book.topics.atomizer`.

:attr:`Actor._handle_class`
:class:`TableHandle`

:meth:`get_handle_name` is still used in :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.debts`, where
we want to have different variants of table columns for a slave table. I wrote
this solution before I discovered the recipe for doing this using a choicelist
holding actors. We should replace this by a :term:`choicelist of actors`.
