=====================

I fixed the first issue observed :doc:`0704`. Explanation: when the date of a
suggested event gets modified by the user, Lino aligns all following events
accordingly. Change: From now on Lino also verifies that such a date change
remains within its limits. You cannot go back in time. When lesson 1 was on a
given date, you cannot make lesson 2 happen before lesson 1.  I changed the
algorithm and internal API for analyzing the existing events.

I found and fixed another bug: create an activity without enrolments, let it
generate some events, pick one of the events, manually add a guest, mark the
event as took_place. Then try to delete the activity. Lino simply did this. Now
it says "Cannot delete X because it has user-modified calendar entries."

Internal change:
I renamed :meth:`update_cal_rset` to :meth:`get_recurrence_set`.

I extended the documentation about
:ref:`ug.ref.plugins.cal.automatic_events`.

I added more test cases in
:file:`lino_book/projects/roger/tests/test_faggio.py`
