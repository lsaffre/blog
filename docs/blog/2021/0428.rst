I changed the URL of the German and French doctrees about welfare. Until now
they were::

    https://de.welfare.lino-framework.org
    https://fr.welfare.lino-framework.org

New URLs are::

    https://welfare.lino-framework.org/de
    https://welfare.lino-framework.org/fr

TODO: Adapt the nginx config files on LF for subdomains `de.welfare` and
`fr.welfare` to add a rewrite rule so that requests to the old URL redirect to
the new URL. Adapt the :ref:`dev.redirected_urls` page so that it verifies that
the new content is being served.
