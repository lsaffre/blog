I pushed my work of the last days  (for :ticket:`632`) to master of lino and
book.

About screenshots
=================

For the first time in the history of Lino I got the
:func:`lino.api.selenium.runserver` function working. It is a bit tricky because
I wanted it to launch a Django development server in the background, then use
selenium to open a headless firefox and run an automated "tour" in the demo
database, taking screenshots on the go. And these screenshots would then be
available for being included in documentation pages.

Here is an example of such a screenshot:

.. image:: ../../../../book/docs/specs/noi/tour/contacts.Companies.grid.params_en.png

This screenshot is taken from :ref:`noi1e.tour`.

But of course every fixed issue causes new questions to raise.

I had to figure out how to organize everything.  Where to store those tours?
They are no longer under :file:`/docs/tours`. I started to care about
internationalization: we don't need "just screenshots", we need them in
different languages. The selenium code that runs the tour is now
language-agnostic and the same tour is run for different users. I converted the
:xfile:`maketour.py` script into a script to be executed with :cmd:`pm run`. I
renamed :class:`lino.api.selenium.Album` to :class:`lino.api.selenium.Tour`.  I
added a test case that actually runs our first :xfile:`maketour.py` script of
the noi1e project.

Where to hook the tours into the doc tree?  They are neither "Specs" nor "API".
Each tour creates one :xfile:`.rst` page, that page is meant as a reference for
the author of application documentation. It describes how the tour has been
done, which screenshots are available, and it gives the names of the image
files.

I removed the tours index page (which was meant to list all
the tours) because that was a useless file to maintain. Rather hook them into
the specs of the application they describe.  So the noi1e tour is now in the
:ref:`noi.specs` section.

I added code in :file:`test_demo.py` that runs the noi1e tour.

I had all this working, but after a system upgrade on my notebook (where also
firefox was updated) it stopped to work again. After another hour of trying to
get it back to work, I decided to abandon, comment out the lines in
:file:`test_demo.py` that would run this test, and put it to sleep again. After
all this is not urgent.

TODO:

- convert the :file:`make_screenshots.py` scripts in :mod:`lino_weleup` and :mod:`lino_welcht`
  to :xfile:`maketour.py` scripts in the `gerd` and `mathieu` demo projects.
- extend the `noi1e` tour to have more screenshots
- write a tour for a react demo
- write a tour outside of the book in an independent application, e.g. amici.
