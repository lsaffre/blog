:class:`lino_xl.lib.phones.ContactDetail` now inherits from
:class:`lino.mixins.periods.DateRange`, i.e.:

- added a field :attr:`lino_xl.lib.phones.ContactDetail.start_date`.
- we can now filter the contact details that are active in a given date range.

TODO:

- A :term:`django-admin command` to load partner details and list memberships
  from a text file containing email addresses (e.g. the output of mailman's
  :command:`list_members` command). What if there are multiple contact details
  with a same address? 

- Allow for contact details without partner: support having them in the
  database and provide a view to see them.
