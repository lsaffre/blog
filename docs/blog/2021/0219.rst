=========================

I found and fixed two minor bugs: in :mod:`lino.modlib.checkdata`: the
``--prune`` option of :manage:`checkdata` didn't actually work. And
:manage:`checkdata` (without ``--prune``) didn't remove obsolete messages of
unbound checkers.  These bugs became visible only now because
:attr:`lino.modlib.uploads.UploadsFolderChecker` is the first :term:`unbound
data checker` that has something to say (if we ignore
:class:`lino_xl.lib.vat.VatColumnsChecker` which is rarely used at the moment.)

New configuration option
:attr:`lino.modlib.uploads.Plugin.remove_orphaned_files`.

I reviewed the :ref:`book.specs.checkdata` page.
Seems I found a way to properly document the
:attr:`check_data <lino.core.model.Model.check_data>` and
:attr:`fix_problems <lino.core.model.Model.fix_problems>` actions.

I converted the settings package of :mod:`lino_book.projects.avanti1` into a
simple :xfile:`settings.py` module. Mostly because I want to write demo fixtures
that upload files, and the media folder is "at the wrong place" in projects with
a settings package.
