============================================
rST localisation for language "et" not found
============================================

Friday, November 19, 2021

Today I upgraded docutils after some time. And afterwards I had the following
warnings when building a website in Estonian::

  /mysite/some/arbitrary/file.rst:: WARNING: rST localisation for language "et" not found.

This was because docutils `now supports i18n
<https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/howto/i18n.html>`__. To fix the problem at
least for me, I said ``cp en.py et.py`` in two source code directories below
docutils:

- .../lib/python3.8/site-packages/docutils/languages
- .../lib/python3.8/site-packages/docutils/parsers/rst/languages
