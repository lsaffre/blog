=====================================
New DashboardLayouts make things slow
=====================================

Tuesday, June 15, 2021

In order to understand the cause of :ticket:`4207`,  I wrote a
testing page :ref:`book.tested.dashboard_sql`
:file:`book/docs/specs/noi/sql_dashboard.rst`, which activates SQL logging, then renders
the dashboard, and then shows the number of database queries that were executed.

New feature for :term:`tested documents <tested document>``:
:meth:`lino.core.requests.BaseRequest.show`
now supports showing a :term:`detail window`.
Side effects:
:meth:`lino.core.site.Site.get_main_html` now takes an `ar` instead of a `request`.
New method :meth:`lino.modlib.jinja.Plugin.render_from_ar`.
New method :meth:`lino.core.renderer.HtmlRenderer.show_detail`.
The output of :func:`lino.api.doctest.show_dashboard` now uses the tex renderer
instead of the site's default renderer.


Note that all this does not yet even try to fix the :ticket:`4207` issue. My
plan is to use these new features on the production site where I plan to
:manage:`run` the following script::

  from lino.api.doctest import *
  reset_sql_queries()
  rt.login('robin').show('system.Dashboard')
  show_sql_summary()
