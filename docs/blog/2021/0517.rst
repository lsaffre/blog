The front page (https://www.lino-framework.org) is now multilingual.

SR is now also considered part of the Lino documentation framework.
Testing linkable pages :ref:`hamza`, :ref:`luc`.

I changed from insipid to pydata sphinx theme.

Note that when I refer to :ref:`lf.framework` via intersphinx, I should get
always the English version.


I did an update of the demos on :ref:`lf`::

  pull.sh
  go cosi1e ; pm prep --noinput
  go noi1r ; pm prep --noinput
  go voga1e ; pm prep --noinput
  sudo service supervisor restart

(Before this I removed some unused repositories from the :xfile:`pull.sh` script,
which was as generated by :term:`getlino`. But e.g. we don't need book, welfare
and some other repositories there.)
