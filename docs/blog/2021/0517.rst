The front page (https://www.lino-framework.org) is now multilingual.

SR is now also considered part of the Lino documentation framework.
Testing linkable pages :ref:`hamza`, :ref:`luc`.

I changed the sphinx theme from insipid to pydata. Mostly because insipid had
two disturbing oddities on a mobile phone: the sidebar menu didn't hide away
after selecting another page from the menu. And in some situations the font
weight of a whole page changed when you first touched it.

Note that when I refer to :ref:`lf.framework` via intersphinx, I should get
always the English version.


I did an update of the demos on :ref:`lf`::

  pull.sh
  go cosi1e ; pm prep --noinput
  go noi1r ; pm prep --noinput
  go voga1e ; pm prep --noinput
  sudo service supervisor restart

(Before this I removed some unused repositories from the :xfile:`pull.sh` script,
which was as generated by :ref:`getlino`. But e.g. we don't need book, welfare
and some other repositories there.)

Sharif and I had a 2,5 hours extreme programming session where we did an
extensive reorganization of the site_data for :ticket:`4102`. That was fun!
