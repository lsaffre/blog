=======================

I am working on compound ticket :ticket:`4302` for :ref:`cosi`. This page is my
progress summary.

WAITING:

- Remove the "payment method" field. We don't use it in Così. --> Not sure
  whether we want this. Think more. Maybe we can use the payment method also in
  a simple Così.

DONE:

- Add phones plugin to Cosi
- "Introductive text" should be printed before the table of items. And the field
  label is not translated to German.
- Remove the VAT class "vehicles" in bevat and bevats
- Show the VAT rate in the designations of VAT classes
- intra-community sales invoice were not booked correctly in bevat



TODO:

- Enter and register a purchase invoice doesn't work when the accounting period
  doesn't exist.
- Adapt the payment date when voucher_date changes. Waiting for
  :ticket:`4305`.

- The :meth:`__str__` of an unregistered voucher currently says "jnl #id", but
  that's irritating.
- Export the list of intracom customers to XML
- Write a data checker to report duplicate or missing invoice numbers


For Sharif:

- When hitting :kbd:`Insert` in a grid view of invoice items, the new item
  should get inserted before the currently selected row.

- The icon of the toggle_state action is not rendered in ExtJS
