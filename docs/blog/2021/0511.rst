I optimized the docs about copyright on :ref:`lino.contrib.legal` and
:ref:`ss.free`.

We can be really thankful for Sharif.  Thanks to him the :ref:`React <react>` front end
is again "in good hands" (as Tonis expressed it). During the last weeks Sharif
has gained deep knowledge of the Lino internals, together we have very efficient
extreme programming sessions, he also actively contributes issue reports to the
PrimeReact community. For his reporting  of `issue 2008
<https://github.com/primefaces/primereact/issues/2008>`_ he earned thanks from
`Mert Sincan <https://github.com/mertsincan>`__ who wrote "Good catch! Thanks a
lot for your report!". And last but not least, the :ref:`shop` project is
advancing.

I start to imagine that we will soon get yet another doctree. The :ref:`book`
should rather be published under a subdomain like `dev.lino-framework.org`  and
the main front page at `www.lino-framework.org` should rather be an independant
doctree that serves as entry point into the other doctrees. It would basically
say what currently is said on `lino.doctrees`.
