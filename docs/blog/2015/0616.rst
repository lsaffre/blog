Cleanable files
===============

Theoretically it is necessary to explicitly delete the `.rst`
documents generated by
`autosummary<http://sphinx-doc.org/latest/ext/autosummary.html>`__.

Until now I had to do this manually using commands like::

   $ rm docs/api/lino.*

Note that one file of the `docs/api` directory is **not** generated
and must *not* get deleted accidentally: `index.rst`

Added a new atelier setting :attr:`cleanable_files
<atelier.fablib.env.cleanable_files>`, so now the files are cleaned up
together with :cmd:`fab clean` (if I have defined
:attr:`cleanable_files <atelier.fablib.env.cleanable_files>` in the
project's :xfile:`fabfile.py`).


Checkin
=======

I finished and committed the changes started :doc:`yesterday <0615>`.
