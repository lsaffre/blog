Continued on new ticket :ticket :`188` (printing an art61 contract).

Added four fields `title`, `status`, `cv_duration` and `regime` to
:class:`lino_welfare.modlib.art61.models.Contract`.  These fields are
the same as in `cv.Experience` except that (1) `duration` is
`cv_duration` because we have already another field `duration` (number
of days) from `JobSupplyment` and (2) we must set a `related_name` for
`regime` to avoid a name clash on `cv.Regime` caused by
`jobs.Contract.regime`.


Fixed an unreported bug which caused a TypeError :message:`filter()
argument after ** must be a mapping, not NoneType`

Move standard data for `cv.Regime` and `cv.Status` from
:mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.jobs` to :mod:`lino.modlib.cv`.

Worker Ouvrier

Fixed an unreported bug which caused a FieldError :message:`Cannot
resolve keyword 'success' into field.` when specifying a non-empty
value in filter parameter "Successfully ended" (:attr:`ending_success
<lino_welfare.modlib.isip.mixins.ContractBaseTable.ending_success>`)
in a contract table.
