Cannot print table as pdf
=========================

Working on Ticket :ticket:`384`. I did not yet manage to reproduce the
problem on my machine! But on the customer's site it happens almost
for every table:

    Error while evaluating the expression "table(ar)" defined in the
    "from" part of a statement. UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't
    decode byte 0xc3 in position 13: ordinal not in range(128)

:class:`lino.modlib.appypod.mixins.PrintTableAction`
Added test case :ref:`noi.specs.as_pdf` 
and updated 
:ref:`welfare.specs.integ` 


Ticket :ticket:`269` is almost done! Python 2.7 already passes on
Travis!  Only Python 2.6 still failing. I might even drop support for
2.6, but the issues seem minor:

And then... yes:
