Still working on the docs
=========================

Continued to change the main page of :doc:`/dev/index`. Instead of
just listing the titles of subsections, I add a summary of every
section.


No more need to set `user_model`
================================

The :mod:`lino.modlib.users` plugin now automatically sets
:attr:`user_model <lino.core.Site.user_model>`.  

Until now, application developers had to set :attr:`user_model
<lino.core.Site.user_model>` to ``'users.User'`` **and** add
:mod:`lino.modlib.users` to their
:meth:`lino.core.site.Site.get_installed_apps` in order to enable
:doc:`user management </dev/users>`.

To make the implementation more clean, I added new methods
:meth:`lino.core.plugin.Plugin.on_init`
and
:meth:`lino.core.site.Site.set_user_model`.
