Logging optimizations
=====================

While looking for the explanation of a local problem in Eupen I made a
few optimizations about what to log into the :xfile:`system.log`
file. Or more precisely what to *not* log there: I converted some
calls to `logger.info` into calls to `clint.textual.puts`.

This revealed the problem that
`clint <https://github.com/kennethreitz/clint>`__ does not seem to like
unicode strings. Here is a simple example:

.. literalinclude:: 0617a.py

According to the `unicode.py
<https://github.com/kennethreitz/clint/blob/master/examples/unicode.py>`__
example this should work.  But at least on my machine (with the latest
released clint, version 0.4.1) it causes the following traceback::

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "0617a.py", line 3, in <module>
        puts(u"Ein Blumensträußchen")
      File "/home/luc/pythonenvs/py27/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/clint/textui/core.py", line 58, in puts
        s = map(str, s)
    UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xe4' in position 13: ordinal not in range(128)

Aha, I am not the first one to stumble over it:
https://github.com/kennethreitz/clint/issues/48


- Added new function :func:`lino.utils.puts` which currently just
  prints the string to stdout using ``print``. I prefer to use this
  over a plain ``print`` statement because I guess that there will be
  problems (mainly thinking about the fact that writing to stdout is
  considered an error in a wsgi application).

- In :meth:`lino.core.kernel.Kernel.kernel_startup` we had the line::

    logger.info(self.welcome_text())

  I first replaced it by::

    puts(self.welcome_text())

  But then decided to even remove it completely. Because I cannot
  remember a single case where it has been actually useful that this
  message appears automatically at the console. At least in order to
  observe.

Developers Guide
================

:ref:`sandeep` made suggestions about the
:ref:`lino.dev`.
I worked on :ref:`lino.tutorial.polls`.


Voice session with Sandeep
==========================

Together with :ref:`sandeep` we created :ticket:`301`.
