A calendar navigator for my blog
================================

I spent two hours with optimizing :mod:`atelier.sphinxconf.blog`.  My
blog now features an automatic calendar navigator. I just wanted to
move the old years to a less visible place without loosing them from
the global toctree.  I am using this blogging system already since
2009.


Repairing data using a script
=============================

Yesterday we decided to write and run a rather simple but critical
batch operation in a production database.

Here is the script shortly before I actually ran it:

.. literalinclude:: 0331.py

I discovered that the `puts` of clint does not like unicode
strings. Which is a pity.

I wrote documentation for :class:`PseudoRequest
<lino.core.utils.PseudoRequest>` and moved it from :mod:`lino.api.dd`
to :mod:`lino.core.utils`.
