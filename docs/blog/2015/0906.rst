A new team member
=================

Welcome to Hamza Khchine from Tunisia who is going to invest some of
his time for Lino. Hamza has good chances of becoming my assistant.


Read SEPA data from the bank
============================

I created a new ticket :ticket:`505`:

    Add functionality for reading SEPA data (the "statements",
    i.e. details of movements for each account) from the bank into
    Lino. TIM currently does that using CODA files, but it is better
    to switch to XML.

    For the moment in :mod:`lino.modlib.sepa` there is just one model
    `Account`. We will have new models `Statement`, `Movement` and
    `Info`.

    See `Les extraits de compte codifi√©s (Les formats XML et CODA)
    <https://www.belfius.be/professional/fr/banque-par-vous-meme/services/reporting-coda/index.aspx>`_
    (we probably need format MX.CAMT.053), i.e. `XML message for
    statement (Implementation guidelines)
    <https://www.febelfin.be/sites/default/files/files/Standard-XML-Statement-v1-en_0.pdf>`_
    applies)


Problems with TinyMCE popups
============================

In :mod:`lino.modlib.tinymce` I switched back from 3.5.11 to 3.4.8
because I had again problems with the popup windows (see :ticket:`443`
and :attr:`lino.modlib.tinymce.Plugin.document_domain`).  Just to try
if the version is involved.


A User's Guide for Lino Noi
===========================

I started a first draft of a User's Guide for :ref:`noi`:
:ref:`noi.guide`.  This is work in progress. Not yet too urgent.
Ticket :ticket:`507`.

KeyError: u'' in request POST /api/sepa/AccountsByClient
========================================================

I created and fixed ticket :ticket:`508`. And a new test case
:mod:`lino_welfare.projects.std.tests.test_sepa`.
