ChildCollector has no attribute "add_batch"
-------------------------------------------

I wrote a new tutorial :doc:`/tutorials/mti/index`.  This content is
actually old. Until now they were in `lino.test_apps.mti.tests`, where
nobody could find them.  And furthermore they were not being
tested. And when I added them to the test suite, this revealed that
:func:`lino.utils.mti.delete_child` was no longer working with recent
Django versions. It failed with above error message.  I didn't
investigate when exactly it stopped to work: theoretically it should
have stopped with Django 1.6.x but, the online demos use Django 1.6.5
and seem to not have a problem.

And yet another new tutorial, especially for :ref:`mma`:
:doc:`/tutorials/letsmti/index` adds polymorphism to the LETS
tutorial.

Released Lino 1.6.17
--------------------

I released Lino 1.6.17 on PyPI.
