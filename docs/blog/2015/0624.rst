'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get_body_template'
======================================================

When the :attr:`owner <lino.modlib.excerpts.models.Excerpt.owner>` of
an excerpt was a broken GFK, then it was not possible to see the
detail of that excerpt because :meth:`get_body_template
<lino.modlib.excerpts.models.Excerpt.get_body_template>` caused a
traceback :message:`'NoneType' object has no attribute
'get_body_template'`. Fixed.


Better documentation for Getting started
========================================

I continued to integrate Sandeep's suggestions into
:ref:`lino.tutorial.polls`.
