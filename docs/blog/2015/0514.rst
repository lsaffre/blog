======================

I fixed :ticket:`213` (Lino doesn't display newly created record).

Ticket :ticket:`218` (Remove ticket state "Callback", merge "fixed"
and "tested" into "Done") is done.

Continued on ticket :ticket:`188` (Printing art61 contracts). 
I invested two hours to write a cool new feature:
``lino.tested.counter`` (document moved to :mod:`lino.utils.jinja`).

First usage example is :xfile:`art61/Contract/contract.body.html`.

I moved some definitions of global template functions from
:meth:`get_printable_context
<lino.core.site.Site.get_printable_context>` to
:func:`lino.core.web.site_setup`.
