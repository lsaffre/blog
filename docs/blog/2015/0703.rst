Configuring print templates
===========================

Yesterday I worked the whole day for making the Lino documentation
better, and still I am not satisfied!

Continued to work on 
:ref:`welfare.admin.printing`, 
:ref:`lino.admin.printing` and
:ref:`lino.admin.excerpts`.

One "problem" when I am writing documentation about Lino is that while
thinking about how to explain it, I usually get ideas for making the
code better (structure, API, new features, ...). On of these ideas
today was the new plugin :mod:`lino.modlib.printing` which regroups
what was in :mod:`lino.mixins.printable` before.



java.io.IOException: APDU response error: 27823
===============================================

Users reported some error messages by :ref:`eidreader`. I started a
new documentation page :ref:`eidreader.issues`.


#319 (type object 'ClientEvents' has no attribute 'created')
============================================================

This error message appeared in
:class:`integ.<lino_welfare.modlib.integ.models.ActivityReport>` Added
a section in `docs/tested/integ.rst` to reproduce it.  Added new
client event
:class:`lino_welfare.modlib.pcsw.choicelists.ClientCreated`.

Trying to write a doctest unveiled another issue: A
:class:`lino.utils.reports.Report` is not a normal table but a
subclass :class:`EmptyTable <lino.utils.reports.EmptyTable>`.  And the
:meth:`ses.show <lino.core.requests.BaseRequest.show>` method failed
on this kind of actor with an error message::

  `AttributeError: type object 'ActivityReport' has no attribute 'to_rst'`

This was issue #320 (Lino cannot show report to console).
Quite some changes in :mod:`lino.utils.reports` and elsewhere.
