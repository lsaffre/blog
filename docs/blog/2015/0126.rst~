========================

Continued to work on :doc:`/tutorials/lets/index`.  

I wrote a first proof of concept for :ticket:`52`: Not a displayfield
but a HtmlBox (because there might be more than one line of
text). Otherwise as expected, simply a clickable comma-separate
list. TODO: add some management buttons, How can we specify a
verbose_name fotr offered_products and wanted_products?



Worked on :ticket:`5`. This was almost done, except for a new field
`proof` (Nachweis, Preuve) and a model `Proof`.  Default data for this
table in :mod:`lino_welfare.projects.chatelet.modlib.cv.fixtures.std`
according to Mathieu's request "colonne “Valeur” (en liste déroulante
que nous compléterons avec : Déclaratif, Certificat, Attestation,
Diplôme, Validation de compétences)".

Moved :doc:`/dev/ml/cv` to the source code.  Added a new Site
attribute :attr:`lino.core.site.Site.ignore_model_errors` because I
thought it would help, but then discovered that I cannot show table
data in docstrings for the cv2 module because the Lino docs are built
during a single Python process and thus cannot use more than one
:xfile:`settings.py`. Started a new tested document
:ref:`welfare.tested.cv2`.

Added two tickets :ticket:`75` and :ticket:`76` after meeting with
:ref:`gx`.
