I took some time to think about a subtle question. In Chatelet they
have so-called psychosocial interventions. And they want to handle
them like workshops (which may be a wrong decision, but the customer
is king).  The enrolment to such a psychosocial interventions should
be printed as a document "Demande dâ€™intervention psychosociale". The
template for this document is quite different from normal enrolments.
That's why we now have a new field
:attr:`lino.modlib.courses.models.Line.body_template`.


Fixed ticket :ticket:`244` (When SiteConfig.next_partner_id points to
existing id): Lino now says :message:`Cannot create partner with
id=X. Check your next_partner_id in SiteConfig!` when that case
occurs.


Thanks to :ticket:`232` (Better API for class-based choices) and in
order to prepare for :ticket:`239` (New filter parameter for
pcsw.Clients), I converted the method for defining **observed events**
on client tables.
New tested document :ref:`welfare.tested.clients`.
