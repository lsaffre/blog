A little bug caused a big change
================================

I got this message::

    AttributeError at /templates/notes/NotesByProject/9994/body
    'User' object has no attribute 'users_membership_set_by_user'
   
Which caused me to tidy up something which had been lying under the
carpet for a long time: Convert the `use_tinymce` setting into a
optional plugin :mod:`lino.modlib.tinymce`.

TODO: 

- When the user tries to insert a template, the combobox is still
  empty.
- The :file:`/media/lino/tinymce/Ext.ux.TinyMCE.js` is currently still
  in :file:`/lino/media`. This is a case where we should start to use
  `Django's static files
  <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/howto/static-files/>`__.
