Change from KDE to Gnome
========================

For my everyday's work I will probably switch from KDE (Ubuntu's
default window manager) to Gnome::

    $ sudo aptitude install gnome

    The following packages have unmet dependencies:
     libgl1-mesa-dri-lts-utopic : Conflicts: libgl1-mesa-dri but 10.1.3-0ubuntu0.4 is to be installed.
     libgl1-mesa-dri-lts-utopic:i386 : Conflicts: libgl1-mesa-dri but 10.1.3-0ubuntu0.4 is to be installed.
     xserver-xorg-lts-utopic : Conflicts: libgl1-mesa-dri (>= 0~) but 10.1.3-0ubuntu0.4 is to be installed.
    The following actions will resolve these dependencies:

         Keep the following packages at their current version:   
    1)     libgl1-mesa-dri [Not Installed]                       

         Leave the following dependencies unresolved:            
    2)     xserver-xephyr recommends libgl1-mesa-dri (>= 7.1~rc1)



Notify changes in tickets
=========================

I solved ticket :ticket:`559` : qhen a ticket gets created, updated or
deleted, then all interested users (who have their email field filled)
will get niotified by email. Commits to lino and noi, and release to
:ref:`lf`.

Originally I thought that this was just a change in the local
:xfile:`settings.py`, but in fact it is now implemented in
:meth:`lino_noi.projects.team.settings.Site.do_site_startup` and
required a series of new features in :mod:`lino.utils.sendchanges`:

- It is now possible to define more than one emitter per model

- It is now possible to define custom emitters, which Noi uses to
  override :meth:`get_recipients` to provide a dynamic list of
  recipients per ticket.

- :func:`lino.core.fields.fields_list` now supports a wildchard.
- New method :meth:`lino.modlib.stars.models.Star.for_obj`

This is a first proof of concept. There will be unexpected "details"
to solve. The three email templates will need optimization.  One
probable optimization is that Lino should send only one notification
when there are several changes "in a row" (i.e. something like "when a
ticket has been changed and notified, subsequent changes should not
notify again until the user has seen the ticket").

Miscellaneous
=============

I adapted :ref:`faggio` after :ticket:`520`.
