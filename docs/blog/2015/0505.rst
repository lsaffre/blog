====================

I realized that sendchanges won't help for :ticket:`178` because the
list of subscribers is dynamic. Which indicates that
:mod:`lino.utils.sendchanges` was maybe a fundamentally wrong
approach.

I changed the :attr:`on_ui_updated <lino.core.signals.on_ui_updated>`
signal: `sender` is again the database model (i.e. the class object),
and the :class:`lino.utils.ChangeWatcher` is passed as a named
argument `watcher`.

I added a receiver to :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.notes.models` which
reports every change on a note to all colleagues.
