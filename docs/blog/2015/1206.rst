========================

Yet another optimization for :ticket:`657`: clicking a username also
fills the password field. So now even people who never read onscreen
instructions will find their way into a Lino demo application
(:attr:`is_demo_site <lino.core.site.Site.is_demo_site>`).

I finished some last ideas about **defining screenshot albums**
(:ticket:`632`) in :ref:`welfare.de.tour` and
:ref:`welfare.fr.tour`. I plan to soon start a similar tour for
:ref:`cosi`.

When **building the docs** I noticed :ticket:`658`, which was caused by a
forgotten experimental line in Lino's :xfile:`conf.py`::

    autodoc_default_flags = ['no-imported-members']

There were other minor problems, e.g. some references to "faggio" had
not yet been changed to "voga". Or Links like
:attr:`user_profiles_module
<lino.core.site.Site.user_profiles_module>` did not work from the
Welfare Specs because of a bug in the Welfare docs :xfile:`conf.py`.

I finally started to work on :ticket:`625`.  As expected this is still
a show blocker for the Cos√¨ Tour. Bugfixes. How to select multiple due
movements?

A commit to :mod:`lino_extjs6` is for Django 1.9 (due to
:ticket:`650`) where the pointed model of a `ForeignKey` is no longer
in `field.rel.to` but in `field.rel.model`.
