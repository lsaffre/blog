Changes in Lino Noi
===================

I worked on :ticket:`358` because I need to write a time estimation
for a wishlist with a dozen of tickets.

DONE:

- New ticket state :attr:`Talk
  <lino.modlib.tickets.choicelists.TicketStates.talk>`.

- New field "deadline" (DateField)
- ToDoTickets, TalkTickets
  
- Provide readonly access under public URL
  :mod:`lino_noi.settings.public`

- add a field "priority" (integer 0...100) and then a table
  ToDoTickets.  public todo list

- new field :attr:`lino.modlib.tickets.models.Project.assign_to`

TODO:

- Remove field "modified" because that info is irrelevant. Add a field
  "touched" : the last time somebody worked on this ticket. This is
  either `created` or, if at least one session exists, the `end_time`
  of that session. And then a table RecentTickets
