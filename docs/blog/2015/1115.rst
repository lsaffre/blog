I continued to work on yesterday's idea for :ticket:`559`.  The last
question yesterday was how to trigger the event that a notification
has been :attr:`seen`.

The answer is to override the :meth:`get_detail_title
<lino.core.actors.Actor.get_detail_title>` of the
:class:`Notifications <lino.modlib.stars.models.Notifications>` table.
