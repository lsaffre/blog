ManageAccess requests failed
============================


I fixed a regression bug in :class:`ManageAccessRequest
<lino_welfare.modlib.cbss.models.ManageAccessRequest>` which caused it
to not work. MA requests aren't currently being used in any production
site, that's why this bug had gone unnoticed until now. But we need
them now ManageAccess to run some tests in the acceptation environment
because CBSS is going to change some internal things and they asked us
to test everything in the acceptation environment.

I reactivated a unit test module in :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.cbss`
which had been inactive. It is now in 
:mod:`lino_welfare.projects.eupen.tests.test_cbss`.

I renamed `cbss_live_tests` to :attr:`cbss_live_requests
<lino_welfare.modlib.cbss.Plugin.cbss_live_requests>`.


Checkin and upgrade in Eupen.
