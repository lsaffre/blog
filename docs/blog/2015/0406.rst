=====================

I worked on :ref:`cosi`. 

In the main menu of a default configuration, the "Payment orders"
journal was under "Purchases", not under "Financial" as it should.
The most sustainable way to solve this was to add a new choicelist
:class:`lino.modlib.ledger.choicelists.JournalGroups`.

Oops. Actually I wanted to work today, but then I stumbled again over
a series of readings and accidentally started a document
:doc:`/topics/why_free`.
