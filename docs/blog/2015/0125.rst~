Upgrade with data migration in :ref:`weleup` and :ref:`welcht`. These
are now running version 1.1.21.

Marked :ticket:`47` as fixed because the most visible part is done
and needs feedback. Split remaining part into new :ticket:`71`.

Layout changes and translations for :ref:`welcht`. Some vocabulary:

    A meeting is any kind of calendar event which has guests.

Mahmoud reported two bugs in his `today's blog entry
<http://iamdevops.com/blog/2015/0125.html>`_.  One was a wrong test
case, the other was a real bug which had passed undetected through the
test suite.

I added some test cases so that it would have been detected.

I worked on :doc:`/tutorials/lets/index`.  Lino now again supports
slave tables in a ColumnsLayout (i.e. in column_names).
