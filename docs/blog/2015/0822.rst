Lino with Django > 1.6
======================

Still occupied by ticket :ticket:`38` (Make Lino run with Django 1.7+).

Yesterday I finally managed to get :ref:`lino.tested.diamond2` to pass
also under Django 1.7 by adapting
:func:`lino.core.inject.django_patch`.  But unfortunately this did not
fix our original problem.  

So I now try to isolate this problem in a new test case
:ref:`lino.tested.e006`.

Django 1.7+ issued the following 
`RemovedInDjango19Warning` when extending 
e.g. :mod:`lino.modlib.contacts` by `lino.projects.min2.modlib.contacts`::

    RemovedInDjango19Warning: Model X doesn't declare an explicit app_label and either isn't in an application in INSTALLED_APPS or else was imported before its application was loaded. This will no longer be supported in Django 1.9.

So it is now recommended declare an explicit `Meta.app_label` for
every model of an extendable library plugin::

    class Partner(...):

        class Meta:
            app_label = 'contacts'  # avoid RemovedInDjango19Warning
            abstract = dd.is_abstract_model(__name__, 'Partner')


Finding a colleague
===================

Ticket :ticket:`38` (Make Lino run with Django 1.7+) seems a good
ticket for finding an assistant for me.

Worked on :ref:`lino.tested.e006` in that direction.

Updated the job offer at `Assistant Senior Developer
<http://www.saffre-rumma.net/jobs/seniordev.html>`_

Discovered :ticket:`444` (bugs.lf.org shows no tickets):

The page's source code shows a "<Element u'div' at 0xb3e2324c>" where
the table should be. 
Of course the :meth:`lino.core.requests.BaseRequest.show` method 
must return `E.tostring(e)`  and not `e`. But only 


SectionLayout on bibles.Sections has no data element 'seqno'
============================================================

Ticket :ticket:`445` was a side effect caused by a change some days
ago as part of :ticket:`436` (Hierarchical no longer Sequenced, see
:doc:`0818`). I also added a test case to :mod:`lino_logos`.
