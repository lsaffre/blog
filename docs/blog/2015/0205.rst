Before going into production, I renamed
``lino_welfare.modlib.trainings`` to
:mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.immersion`, and within this module the
`Training` model to `Contract`.

Lino now verifies whether all "plugin modifiers" returned by
:meth:`lino.core.site.Site.get_apps_modifiers` are valid, and
otherwise raises an exception :message:`Invalid app_label 'X in your
get_apps_modifiers!`

Miscellaneous
=============

- Gerd reported ticket :ticket:`92`. Yes, the following was bullshit:

    Acting as another user won't give you the access permissions of
    that user.  A secretary who has authority to act as her boss in
    order to manage his calendar should not also see e.g. statistic
    reports to which she has no access.  For system admins it is
    different: when a system admin acts as another user, he inherits
    this user's access permissions.  System admins use this feature to
    test the permissions of other users.

  The truth is: independently of whether you are admin or not, acting as
  another user means that you get that other user's menu.


- :manage:`show` is now a bit more user friendly: uses `None` instead
  of "root" as default username, and gives a meaningfule message when
  the specified username does not exist.



- :class:`lino_welfare.modlib.pcsw.models.ClientsTest` caused a traceback.
  Fixed.
  And this table is now covered by  :ref:`welfare.tested.pcsw`.
  And en passant I solved ticket :ticket:`71`.

- New method :meth:`lino.modlib.uploads.choicelists.Shortcut.get_queryset`.

- :attr:`lino_welfare.modlib.pcsw.models.Client.primary_coach` is now
  a displayfield (was a property)
