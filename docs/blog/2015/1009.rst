Finished #552
=============

Upgrade on :ref:`lf` for :ticket:`552`. Reality will show whether this
was the good direction.


Continued #353
==============

I continued on :ticket:`353`.

Which made me discover a side effect of the recent changes in
:meth:`lino.core.model.Model.disable_delete` & Co: :ticket:`582`.

The bug was in :func:`lino.utils.mti.delete_child` which cannot use
:meth:`disable_delete` any more since we are not deleting the whole
polymorphic complex object but just a specialisation of it.

I wrote a new test case :mod:`lino_cosi.projects.std.tests.test_ddh`
which reproduced this problem.

Note that this is yet another example of a test case which should
actually be in Lino because it tests a general feature. There are
quite some other examples in :ref:`noi` and :ref:`welfare`.
Theoretically we should write a separate test application and cover
these cases within the Lino repository.  Currently this is not a big
problem because there is only one Lino team.  Just keep in mind: in
order to make sure that Lino is tested, a developer should verify also
the test suites of these projects.

The detail of partners, persons and
companies had lost its tab panel for accounting. New module
:mod:`lino_cosi.lib.contacts`

I changed the default value of :attr:`enter_submits_form
<lino.modlib.extjs.Plugin.enter_submits_form>` to `False`.
