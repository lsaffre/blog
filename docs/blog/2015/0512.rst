I discovered another series of bugs in `IdentifyPersonRequest` which
had slipped undiscovered because demo fixtures were not being loaded
anymore.


I started :ticket:`195` in order to write release notes for Gerd.
Before releasing it, I wanted to finish :ticket:`164`.
This caused a complete new option plugin :mod:`lino.modlib.stars`.

Added new model :class:`lino.modlib.tickets.models.TicketType`.

Added new link type :attr:`lino.modlib.tickets.choicelists.LinkTypes.deploys`.
