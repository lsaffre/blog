========================

I wanted to send a list of tickets deployed in the coming release for
my customer, but Lino Noi said :ticket:`453` (invalid worksheet name
u'Deployed tickets von weleup:com'). Fixed.

Continued to repair the test suite (mostly due to changes caused by
:ticket:`143`).

Checkin (also changes of yesterday).

I tested the new :attr:`log_each_action_request
<lino.core.site.Site.log_each_action_request>` because we will
probably activate it for some time in Eupen after our emotions around
the murder bug.  I discovered that some actions did't have their
:attr:`readonly <lino.core.action.ACtions.readonly>` attribute set to
`False` and therefore were not logged.


Release in Eupen
================

After the upgrade and when restoring the dump, I decided to write a
migrator, mainly in order to make sure that no IBAN/BIC fields stored
on Partner get lost.  Worked a bit on :ref:`lino.datamig`.


Empty budgets
=============

Exploring :ticket:`329`.  Here is a Lino script (designed to be
invoked with :cmd:`pm run`) which prints all empty budgets::

    from lino.api.shell import *
    from django.db.models import Count
    qs = debts.Budget.objects.annotate(num=Count('entry')).filter(num__gt=0)
    for obj in qs:
        print obj.id, obj.user.username

object of type 'generator' has no len()
=======================================

Fixed a bug which occurred when printing a release report with a
recipient in Lino Noi::

  Error while evaluating expression 
  "this.excerpt_type.print_recipient and this.has_address()". 
  TypeError: object of type 'generator' has no len()
