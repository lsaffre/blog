I still worked on :ticket:`134`. Yes, the step of moving from Trac to
:mod:`lino_noi` will continue to take quite some of my energy during
the next weeks.

DONE:

- convert 'standby' and 'closed' to Booleanfields

I even opend a first separate ticket :ticket:`150` (public web
interface) for this project.

- many tables (at least their menu entries) were visible to anonymous
  users. 

  That was just a bug: the default value for the `auth` permission
  requirement (which is True when :attr:`lino.core.Site.user_model` is
  not None, otherwise False) was set too early.


- A side effect: :class:`lino.utils.report.EmptyTable` no longer is a
  Printable (but :class:`lino.utils.report.Report` is). That was
  mainly to remove the useless "Print" button from
  :class:`lino.modlib.about.models.About`

TODO

- public interface for tickets
