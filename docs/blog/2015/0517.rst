====================


A little change which should improve the API when defining class-based
choices of a choicelist: :meth:`Choice.__init__
<lino.core.choicelists.Choice.__init__>` no longer sets a default
value for `name` if no name is specified. The name of a choice is
optional, the value isn't. Until now the `name` defaulted to `value`
and was never `None`.

Which caused me to tidy up the documentation about
:ref:`dev.choicelists`.

Started final sprint before next release in chatelet.

- More translations
- Added new field :attr:`Obstacle.detected_date
  <lino_welfare.projects.chatelet.modlib.cv.models.Obstacle.detected_date>`
