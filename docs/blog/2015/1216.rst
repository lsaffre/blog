============================

I opened and fixed :ticket:`668`. This was because the :func:`getrqdata
<lino.core.utils.getrqdata>` function did not yet support `HEAD`
requests.  Thanks to `this thread on SO
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1977945/best-practice-for-handling-http-head-request-with-django-on-app-engine>`_
I found the note under Django's `require_safe
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/decorators/#django.views.decorators.http.require_safe>`_
decorator which says:

    Django will automatically strip the content of responses to HEAD
    requests while leaving the headers unchanged, so you may handle
    HEAD requests exactly like GET requests in your views. Since some
    software, such as link checkers, rely on HEAD requests, you might
    prefer using require_safe instead of require_GET.

I continued to fix some last test failures in :ref:`cosi` which had been 

The following code caused problems in an application with no
`project_model`::

    @dd.virtualfield(dd.ForeignKey(dd.plugins.ledger.project_model))
    def project(self, row, ar):
        return row.project

This is a VirtualField whose return_type is a DummyField.
Lino now supports this.
