========================

I moved module :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.countries` to
:mod:`lino.modlib.statbel.countries` and finished to digest what I
discovered yesterday (not *definitively* finished of course, but for
this time): 

- The :meth:`set_detail_layout
  <lino.core.actors.Actor.set_detail_layout>` method is still
  necessary and useful. We cannot simply subclass a table when we want
  to override its `detail_layout`, because when that table has
  subclasses who did *not* define their own `detail_layout`, then we
  also want to override thoses classes' `detail_layout`.  (The same
  applies to `insert_layout` of course.)

- We *did* get rid of two :func:`inject_field
  <lino.core.inject.inject_field>` usages.

- Updated :lino:`/dev/plugin_inheritance`.  

I removed the source files of my blog from the Lino repository, since
they are now available from `github.com/lsaffre/blog`.

I worked a bit in `An introduction to Lino Cos√¨
<http://cosi.lino-framework.org/tour/index.html>`_.
