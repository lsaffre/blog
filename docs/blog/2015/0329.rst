Resetting a database
====================

Still trying to understand what's happening in :manage:`initdb` with
InnoDB. The most straightforward solution is to drop the whole
database and to create a new one. Now I discovered why it did not
work: with MySQL we need to "close" the conenction by saying ``del
connections[alias]``. Although this solution is engine-specific I have
the feeling that it is the best one.
