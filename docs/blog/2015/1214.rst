I continued to work on :ticket:`143`.  

I understood that the *project* of a purchase invoice (i.e. the client
in Lino Welfare) must go to the *partner's* movement, not to the
account's movement.  And when a purchase invoice is distributed over
several projects, then Lino must split the partner's movement.


A new little utility is :class:`lino.utils.SumCollector`.
