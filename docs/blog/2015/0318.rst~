Reference to the module's source code
=====================================

Some days ago I thought that the sentence with the reference to the
module's source code (which is added by
:func:`atelier.sphinxconf.base.autodoc_add_srcref`) whould better be
the first sentence of the page because it can be difficult to
find. But now I (re)discovered we we must add it *after* the module
description (not before): it is because also autosummary gets the
docstring processed by this handler.
