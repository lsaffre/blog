The commands in :mod:`lino.modlib.notes` and
:mod:`lino.modlib.uploads` which were available to
:class:`lino.modlib.office.roles.OfficeUser` are now also available to
:class:`lino.modlib.office.roles.OfficeOperator`.


I spoke with Mathieu about several examples of documents used in
Ch√¢telet and how to have them generated by Lino:

- :class:`lino_welfare.modlib.art61.models.Contract` - done. waiting
  for their feedback

- :file:`Convention de mise en situation` and :file:`Convention de
  stage` are printouts of a
  :class:`lino_welfare.modlib.immersion.models.Contract`.  For which
  we are going to have two templates: (1) contacts for internal use
  and (2) contracts managed by FOREM.

- :file:`Orientation Savoirs de base`, :file:`Orientation cyber
  logement` and :file:`Fiche intervention psy` are printouts of a
  workshop enrolment
  :class:`lino_welfare.modlib.courses.models.Enrolment`.

- :file:`Orientation SIS` is a printout of a
  :class:`lino_welfare.modlib.pcsw.models.Coaching`
