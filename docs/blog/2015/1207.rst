========================

The Lino Polls online demo was still broken after :ticket:`650`.  This
demo is a bit special because it uses some tricks (e.g. symbolic
links) to directly use the files defined in the
:srcref:`docs/tutorial/polls`.  The reason was some import problem.
After solving this it took me some time to realize that another
problem was "just" a missing directory for the log file.  That was
because the error handling in :func:`lino.utils.log.configure` was not
propagated.

I updated the following pages:

- http://cosi.lino-framework.org/
- http://www.saffre-rumma.net/cosi/
- http://www.saffre-rumma.net/fr/about/

I continued to work on :ticket:`625`.  The question is how to manage
the situation of entering a BankStatement for a partner who has
multiple due movements. The user must somehow have the possibility of
selecting one or several from these suggestions
