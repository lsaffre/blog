The period of a confirmation
============================

Melanie reported some grammar bugs in the "when" text of confirmations.
Ticket :ticket:`113`.

- The `Confirmation.start_date` no longer defaults to today.  Leaving
  both dates empty is now accepted as a valid confirmation and means
  that the confirmation does not mention any period in its text.

- Moved the business logic from
  :class:`lino_welfare.modlib.aids.mixins.Confirmation` to
  :class:`lino.mixins.periods.DatePeriod`.

- Added a section "The period of a confirmation" to :ref:`welfare.tested.aids`


Validating an action parameter form
===================================

A user in Eupen discovered the following bug:
:class:`CreateClientVisit
<lino_welfare.modlib.reception.models.CreateClientVisit>`
accepts to create visits with an empty `user` field.

And indeed, the client-side form validation does not work here. Ticket
:ticket:`114`.

As a workaround I test it now manually in the action's run_from_ui method::

    if not pv.user:
        raise Warning(_("Please select a user!"))

This caused another subtle change with possible side effects: when
`run_from_ui` raises an exception, Lino (until now) still closed the
action form window. Now the window is closed only when the action runs
without anyu exception.

Mahmoud solved ticket :ticket:`109`.

ImportError: No module named bs4
================================

Ha! I found the explanation for the current problem on travis. The
Lino test suite was failing there with error messages
:message:`ImportError: No module named bs4`. Explanation:

beautifulsoup4_ is actually needed only when you want to run the test
suite, not for normal operation.  Despite this it must be specified in
`install_requires`, not in `tests_require`, because the doctests are
run in the environment specified by `install_requires`. (Don't ask me
*why*...  :meth:`atelier.test.TestCase.run_simple_doctests` uses the
python specified by `sys.executable`, which seems a robust approach.)

The same is true for html5lib, reportlab and pisa.

Now that this riddle is finally solved, there are unfortunately more
failures of the test suite on travis (sigh!). One of them was an easy
pick: :doc:`/dev/translate/index` required :ref:`cosi`.  But the
remaining ones are again quite a brain-teaser for a poor guy as me.
