Started branch "novat"
======================

This weekend I did quite some changes for :ticket:`143`.  Most things
are currently broken, but I'd like to commit my work of the last days
because this project is probably going to rest for a week (two urgent
TIM customer requests, and on Thursday I'm leaving for Rakvere until
Sunday).

The changes are mainly due to the fact that we want to integrate the
existing accounting modules into Lino Welfare, but *without* the
notion of VAT.  PCSWs have accounts, ledger, journals, movements,
invoices, bank statements, payment orders like every accounting
system, but they don't want to have three totals (total_excl,
total_vat, and total_incl) for every operation. New module
:mod:`lino.modlib.novat`.

``git status`` reports a dozen of modified files, one deletion, one
rename, and about 6 new files (classified as the usual "Changes to be
committed", "Changes not staged for commit" and "Untracked files").

And these changes are in two repositories `lino` and `welfare`.

``git status`` also reports "On branch master" for both repos.

In the Lino repo it adds "Your branch is up-to-date with
'origin/master'." (TODO: explain this.)

This is a situation where a branch is useful.  Here is how to create a
branch from my local changes (to be done in both repos) ::

    $ git checkout -b novat

Now I can add my local changes and commit as usual::

    $ git add <specify new files>
    $ fab ci

Later I will need to merge the `novat` branch into `master`.
