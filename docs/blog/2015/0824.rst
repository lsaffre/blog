I fixed on :ticket:`443` (Cannot insert HTML links using TinyMCE).

The problem seems to be local. Maybe I must just run `collectstatic`?
No, that was not the reason.  But ouch, now I see the
explanation. Javascript console says :message:`Error: Permission
denied to access property "tinymce"` in :file:`tiny_mce_popup.js`.
And that file has a comment::

    // Uncomment and change this document.domain value if you are loading the script cross subdomains
    // document.domain = 'moxiecode.com';

And indeed on a production server it is being served from a different
subdomain.  How to solve this? Does Django have a feature of patching
static files before applying them?

And before trying to do it automatically, I changed that line
manually::

  document.domain = 'lino-framework.org';

But this was not enough.  Aha:
- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/572025/tiny-mce-popups-blank-in-django-admin
- http://www.tinymce.com/wiki.php/TinyMCE3x:How-to_load_TinyMCE_crossdomain

So I must also change it in :file:`tinymce.js`.  And finally we have a
new setting :attr:`lino.modlib.tinymce.Plugin.document_domain`.
