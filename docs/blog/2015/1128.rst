Added timezone support (step 1)
===============================

Hamza's work on :ticket:`601` has been waiting because we found more
urgent things to do, but I now would like to advance with this because
(1) it is disturbing to us and (2) I hope that more new developers
will join the Lino Team soon.

So I now looked again at `Hamza's commit
<https://github.com/khchine5/lino/commit/5cf3c7e49b9f7118f019f27762ce5732a05b63e4>`_
and my observations (:doc:`1114`) and integrated them.


TODO: The simple_value combobox for the timezone field does not behave
correctly.


Release on :ref:`lf`
====================

No serious problems, but 

- starting a session still gives the wrong time. That's probably
  because I use some
  :class:`lino_xl.lib.cal.mixins.StartedEnded`

- The hack for Ctrl-S in comboboxes seems to fail again. Did it work
  before?  Maybe never on the production site?  Maybe it is when DEBUG
  is False because then the minimized `ext-all.js` is being used where
  the class names are scrambled?



Old syntax::

    Lino.Viewport = Ext.extend(Ext.Viewport, Lino.MainPanel);
    Lino.Viewport = Ext.extend(Lino.Viewport, {
      layout : "fit"
      ,is_home_page : true
      ,initComponent : function(){
        Lino.Viewport.superclass.initComponent.call(this);
        ...
      }
      ,refresh : function() {
        ...
      }
    });


New syntax::
    

    Ext.define('Lino.Viewport', 
      mixins: [Ext.Viewport, Lino.MainPanel]
      ,layout : "fit"
      ,is_home_page : true
      ,initComponent : function(){
        this.callParent();
        ...
      }
      ,refresh : function() {
        ...
      }
    });
