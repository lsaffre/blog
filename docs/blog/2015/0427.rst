======================

Still struggling with :ticket:`150` which caused a "surprise" which I
actually had been expecting a bit: it turned out to be rather
fundamental and to require a feature which my typical customers don't
see but which is normal for a modern website: integrate a set of
self-written public views together with Lino's ExtJS admin interface.

There are some good news:

- Lino now uses Django's `staticfiles plugin
  <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/contrib/staticfiles/>`__.
  So the repository now includes the static files of third-party
  libraries, and the instructions on :lino:`/admin/media` or the
  "Serving JavaScript frameworks" section in :lino:`/admin/install`
  are no longer necessary.  (TODO: update documentation.)

- Another good thing is that I moved the plugin functionality from
  :mod:`lino` to :mod:`lino.modlib.lino` (and :mod:`lino_welfare` to
  :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.welfare`). This was one of the
  structural changes needed for running Lino with Django 1.7 where
  you cannot have plugins named `foo.modlib.bar` if you also have a
  plugin whose full name is `foo`.  They also required a change in
  atelier: :attr:`atelier.fablib.env.locale_dir`.

The bad news are that (1) these changes were not the solution for my
problem in :ticket:`150` and (2) maybe caused some side effects and
bugs yet to be discovered.

So the :mod:`lino_noi.settings` site still somehow refuses to store
the current user. You can log in, and the POST returns with a success
message, but you still get the index.html for anonymous. As if the
authenticated user somehow doesn't get stored to the session. This
problem seems to exist only with a nonempty :attr:`site_prefix
<lino.core.site.Site.site_prefix>`.
