Fixed a broken link in the README file of `dblog
<https://github.com/lsaffre/dblog>`_.


I did ticket :ticket:`528` (Change license of Lino Welfare from BSD to
AGPL).  Released Lino Welfare version 1.1.25, mainly because ot this
license change. Also released Lino Noi 0.0.2 to PyPI.

I reviewed and updated documentation for :ref:`noi`.
