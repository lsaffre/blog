==========================

Updated documentation at :ref:`admin.oood`.

I wrote some entry points in :mod:`lino.modlib.sepa` for Hanza for
ticket :ticket:`505` (which took me one hour to write, and which would
have taken him many days): :attr:`import_statements_path
<lino.modlib.sepa.Plugin.import_statements_path>`,
:class:`ImportStatements <lino.modlib.sepa.models.ImportStatements>`
and the beginnings of the new models to write.



I â™¥ Lino (version 2)
=====================

Here a second draft of the layout for 
mugs to be used by people who love Lino:

.. raw:: html

Upgrade to lf.org
=================

I am going to activate :mod:`lino_noi.projects.bs3`
on the public interface or 
`our ticket database <http://bugs.lino-framework.org/>`__.

Fixed a :message:`'AnonymousUser' object has no attribute 'user_site'`.

There was another subtle bug which made it impossible to open the
table "Unassigned tickets" (shown in :xfile:`admin_main.html`) in a
separate window. The link was "javascript:oops". This was simply
because that interface has never been used before. Fixed.
