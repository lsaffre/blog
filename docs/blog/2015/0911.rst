Updated documentation at :ref:`admin.oood`.

I wrote some entry points in :mod:`lino.modlib.sepa` for Hanza for
ticket :ticket:`505` (which took me one hour to write, and which would
have taken him many days): :attr:`import_statements_path
<lino.modlib.sepa.Plugin.import_statements_path>`,
:class:`ImportStatements <lino.modlib.sepa.models.ImportStatements>`
and the beginnings of the new models to write.
