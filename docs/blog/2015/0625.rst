I continued to work on :ticket:`173` (Class-based permission control
(UserRoles)). I do this in a separate branch ``class_permissions``. It
causes quite some code changes in lino.modlib and applications.

Basically if you were defining an attribute `required` on a table, you
must replace this by an attribute `required_roles` as shown in the
following examples::

  required = dd.required(user_level="admin")

  required_roles = dd.required(dd.SiteAdmin)


The notions of "UserLevels" (`user_level`) and "UserGroups"
(`user_group`) have been replaced by *user roles*.

The "role" and the "profile" of a user are the same. 

currently still represented
by

TODO: 
rename :class:`UserProfile <lino.modlib.users.choicelists.UserProfile>`
to ``UserRole``
and
:class:`UserProfiles <lino.modlib.users.choicelists.UserProfiles>`
to ``UserRoles``.

The :attr:`profile <lino.modlib.users.models.User.profile>` of a user
now is an instance of some *subclass* of :class:`UserProfile
<lino.modlib.users.choicelists.UserProfile>`.
