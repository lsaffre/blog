I continued to work on :ticket:`173` (Class-based permission control
(UserRoles)). I do this in a separate branch ``class_permissions``. It
causes quite some code changes in lino.modlib and applications. Basically if you were defining an attribute `required` on a table, you must replace this by an attribute `required_roles` as shown in the following examples::

  required = dd.required(user_level="admin")

  required_roles = dd.required(dd.SiteAdmin)
