=======================

I finished yesterday's changes in 
:ref:`lino.tutorial.watch` and
:ref:`lino.tutorial.gfks`.
For example I forgot to also remove the
:attr:`master<lino.modlib.changes.models.Change.master>` field from
:attr:`allow_cascaded_delete
<lino.core.model.Model.allow_cascaded_delete>`.

All test suites now pass, even :ref:`faggio` and :ref:`patrols`.
Commited and pushed them all to master.

Increased the version number for :ref:`welfare` to 1.1.22 and wrote a
:meth:`migrator <lino_welfare.migrate.Migrator.migrate_from_1_1_21>`
(because the account charts model has been replaced by a choicelist
some time ago).
