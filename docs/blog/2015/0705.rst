Some subtle challenges about permissions for the reception clerk
(OfficeOperator) :

-   In :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.aids` we have the following tables:

    .. currentmodule:: lino_welfare.modlib.aids.models

    - :class:`Confirmations`
      - :class:`SimpleConfirmations`
      - :class:`IncomeConfirmations`
      - :class:`RefundConfirmations`

    - :class:`ConfirmationsByGranting` (virtual table)

    A reception clerk must have them because they need to issue new
    entries.

- A reception clerk must have a detail for `pcsw.Client`, and
  `reception.Clients` has a `detail_layout`. But the default table for
  Client is `pcsw.Clients`, which we do *not* want to be visible for
  reception clerks.
