===========================

Release to :ref:`lf` because :ticket:`493` (Ctrl+S to save in text
editor) should be tested on the battle field.

Lots of little bugs came in this afternoon, and I fixed most of them,
wrote test cases. This blog gets more and more redundant with my
sessions reports in Lino Noi. I start to imagine that one day I won't
be blogging this way anymore because everything happens in our
database.  A big advantage of Sphinx is that I can easily write links
to the documentation. But actually this might be done in Lino Noi as
well.
