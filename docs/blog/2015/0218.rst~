============================

Discovered and fixed a bug introduced by the new untested feature
:meth:`get_master_instance
<lino.core.actors.Actor.get_master_instance>`.  When :attr:`master
<lino.core.actors.Actor.master>` was `ContentType` (which is the case
on every XxxByController` table), Lino did not correctly set the
`master_instance` of the action request (a :class:`TableRequest
<lino.core.tablerequest.TableRequest>`).  Added a section to
:ref:`welfare.tested.integ` which would have detected this.

:class:`lino.modlib.cal.AppointmentsByPartner` (Table "Rendez-vous"
dans l'onglet "Personne" ) no longer removes events more than 17 days
in the future. And it now shows events in correct sort order.

Checkin and upgrade in :ref:`chat`.


maximum recursion depth exceeded
================================

The new method :meth:`lino.core.actions.Action.get_status` introduced
yesterday came with another bug: trying to insert a `pcsw.Client`
caused a RuntimeError :message:`maximum recursion depth exceeded while
calling a Python object`.  This triggered another internal revolution
in the action API (which still is unstable and has only very basic
documentation :doc:`/dev/ar`):

- the `ar.insert_button()` method is gone!
- More subtle changes around `ar.get_permission`, `ar.spawn()`,
  `BoundAction.request_from`. `ar.spawn_request` and a `parent`
  keyword to the contructor.
