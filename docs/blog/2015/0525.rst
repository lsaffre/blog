Miscellaneous optimizations for Lino Noi in :mod:`lino.modlib.tickets`
and :mod:`lino.modlib.clocking`. Release on :ref:`lf`.

I started to write first ideas into :ref:`noi.specs.hosts`.

I started to use `GitPython
<http://gitpython.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial.html>`_.  Added
``gitpython`` to the `install_requires` of :mod:`atelier`.  First
useful thing is that :cmd:`fab ci` no longer asks confirmation on a
project whose repository is clean (i.e. has no local changes).  Note
that unlike ``git status``, this does currently not (yet) check
whether my branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
