I continued with :ticket:`353`.

No, we don't need two fields `ship_date` and `ship_ref` because if
somebody wants to generate automatic invoices, these information will
be stored in `invoiceable`.


Added :mod:`lino.modlib.tinymce`, and
:mod:`lino_cosi.projects.std.settings` now sets the global
:attr:`lino.core.site.Site.textfield_format` setting to ``'html'``.
