'NoneType' object has no attribute '__dict__'
=============================================

This occured during :class:`SubmitDetail
lino.core.actions.SubmitDetail>`.

The problem of these tracebacks during an AJAX request is that we have
no idea about how to reproduce them. The traceback does not show the
real problem because the real problem is that the client's javascript
issued an invalid AJAX call.

So I now made the error message more helpful by including the *method*
and *path* of the `HttpRequest
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpRequest>`__
object.  This is being tested e.g. in :ref:`cosi.tested.bel_de`.
