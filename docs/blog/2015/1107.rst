#505 finished
=============

I finished some details for :ticket:`505` (which I saw with Gerd):

- New virtual field :attr:`overview <lino_cosi.lib.sepa.models.Statement.overview>`

- Adapted the import method: the `remote_owner_address` field is a
  list of strings, not a string.

We can now consider ticket :ticket:`505` as closed. If there are more
problem reports (which is probable), I will create new tickets.
