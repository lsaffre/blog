=====================

Checkin at 7am despite the fact that the test suite of :ref:`welfare`
is broken.  Because it is time to start release in Ch√¢telet, and
because the failures are just due to the new language distribution.

I moved the files under `docs/tested` (of Lino Welfare) below
`docs/specs` because this is what they are. Except for the fact that
many of them need more explanations.

Added a new user profile :class:`NewcomersReceptionClerk
<lino_welfare.projects.std.roles.NewcomersReceptionClerk>` to
:mod:`lino_welfare.projects.std.roles`. (In :ref:`cpaschatelet` they will
need to change existing users having profile `210` to this new profile
`220`.
