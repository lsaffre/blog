===========================

I worked several hours and then trashed all my changes. I was trying
to fix a problem that's mainly about generating the docs. The initial
observation was:

- in `apc` we have the sales invoices generated by 
  :mod:`lino_cosi.lib.trading.fixtures.demo`.
  In `std` we have the sales invoices generated by
  :mod:`lino_cosi.lib.ledger.fixtures.demo_bookings`.
  Why does `std` not have both sets of invoices?

The answer was: because :mod:`lino_cosi.projects.std.settings` does
not only define a `Site` class but another class `DocsSite` which is a
hack to get all modules documented in a single Sphinx doctree.

E.g. :mod:`lino_cosi.lib.auto.sales` and :mod:`lino_cosi.lib.trading`.
And then :ref:`welfare` uses a dummy sales module
(:mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.trading`).

- I removed Groupers from :mod:`lino_cosi.lib.finan` because they won't
  be needed when match is a CharField.

- I added a new action per FinancialVoucherItem which opens a
  SuggestionsByFinancialVoucherItem, almost the same as
  ShowSuggestions, but which adds the partner of that item to the
  filter.
