======================

This morning I had an inspiration about how to solve :ticket:`184`:
rstgen.sphinxconf should not automatically add the intersphinx links
of all other projects because that feature is useful only in projects
like my blog. But linking from lino docs to atelier (or from welfare
docs to lino) should remain possible.


Mathieu discovered a rather visible bug which had been living there
probably for years: when the user activated a gridfilter on a
BooleanField, Lino caused a server traceback "ERROR: Join on field
'is_training' not permitted. Did you misspell 'equals' for the lookup
type?".
