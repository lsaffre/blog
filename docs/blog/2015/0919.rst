Hello, world!
=============

This is the first blog entry which I write in my new home.  I moved
from Hoppel to Doll (:ticket:`473`).  Hoppel is a *HP ProBook 4540s*,
Doll is a *Dell Latitude E6430*.

I can confirm a subtle problem which might cause trouble when
:ref:`lino.dev.install`: if ``pip install -e atelier`` or ``pip
install -e lino`` fails because the Python headers are not installed,
then a subsequent call (after ``sudo apt-get install python-dev``)
does *not* install the missing packages. In my case I had to manually
do::

  $ pip install pycrypto ecdsa markupsafe

Here another funny problem reported by Emacs::

    You are not using the same version of Elpy in Emacs Lisp
    compared to Python. This can cause random problems. Please
    do make sure to use compatible versions.

    Elpy Emacs Lisp version: 1.2.1
    Elpy Python version....: 1.9.0


So I did::

    $ pip uninstall elpy
    $ pip install 'elpy==1.2.1'


Later I also saw that I had to reinstall the `elpy package
<https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy>`__.


And another one during `sigal`::

  INFO: Processing /home/luc/dell1tb/cache/sigal_tmp/2014/04/27/img_6793.jpg
  INFO: Failed to process: IOError('decoder jpeg not available',)

Here it was `stackoverflow
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8915296/python-image-library-fails-with-message-decoder-jpeg-not-available-pil>`__
who helped::

  $ sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev

And Emacs had another problem:

    Flymake: Failed to launch syntax check process 'flake8' with args
    (...): Searching for program: no such file or directory,
    flake8. Flymake will be switched OFF

This was because in my `custom.el` I had::

   '(virtualenv-root "~/pythonenvs"))

which was Hoppel's location of my virtualenvs.
