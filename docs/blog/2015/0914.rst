Moved Presto out of Lino
========================

As preparation for :ticket:`520`, I moved :ref:`presto` from the Lino
repository to `a new independent project
<https://github.com/lsaffre/presto>`__. This was to avoid circular
dependencies (:ref:`presto` requires functionality from both
:ref:`cosi` and :ref:`noi`).

I changed the copyright headers in :ref:`presto` from BSD to AGPL as
explained `here <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-howto.en.html>`_.

TODO: 

- Change copyright headers in Cosi, Welfare from BSD to Affero GPL
- The test suites of :ref:`cosi` and :ref:`noi` are broken for minor reasons

Changed Lino Noi from BSD to Affero GPL
=======================================

Done.

Fixed ticket #521
=================

Fixed :ticket:`521` ('NoneType' object has no attribute 'gender' in
request POST /api/debts/BudgetsByPartner) and wrote a test case
:mod:`test_debts <lino_welfare.projects.std.tests.test_debts>` to
verify the fix.

I â™¥ Lino (testing)
===================

I am currently testing version 1 of the Lino mug:

But it seems that none of the two first versions (see :doc:`1 <0904>`
and :doc:`2 <0911>`) will go into production. Ly announced that she
will develop a version 3.
