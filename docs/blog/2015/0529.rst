Some time ago I asked at the sphinx-users group: "The alabaster theme
is very beautiful, but how can I get the `previous | next |
modules | index` links that used to be in the upper right corner?"

Takayuki Shimizukawa answered: By my quick investigation,
alabaster hide such navigation bar if browser width larger than
860px.  You can change this behavior by using custom CSS.
    
Now I had a look at this and tried to change it.

In :file:`.templates/layout.html`, under the line::

  {% extends "!layout.html" %}

added the following line::

  {% set css_files = css_files + ["_static/myalabaster.css"] %}

Then created a file :file:`.static/myalabaster.css` with this content::

    /* override alabaster setting */

    div.document {
        width: 940px;
        margin: 30px auto 0 auto;
    }

But after some fiddling and guessing, I abandoned! The most realistic
way to get back my "previous" and "next" links into the upper margin
is to switch to the class theme::

  html_theme = "classic"
  html_theme_options = dict(collapsiblesidebar=True, externalrefs=True)

Voil√†. Grrr... enough time wasted on purely cosmetic things!  To be
serious, there is one concrete advantage of alabaster: it is more
readable on a smartphone. But sorry, I am not going to ask from
desktop users to resize their browser window in order to see the
"previous" and "next" links.
