=======================

I continued on ticket :ticket:`143`: added a new user profile
:ref:`Accountant <wilfried>` (as I imagine it so far).  


In the morning I got an alert message sent by the cron job which makes
a daily snapshot on :ref:`lf`. The snapshot failed with this error
message::

  django.db.utils.ProgrammingError: (1146, "Table 'miolino.gfks_helptext' doesn't exist")

Stupid me! That was the change on :doc:`0820` (renamed
`lino.modlib.contenttypes` to :mod:`lino.modlib.gfks`). Which I
released to that server yesterday. Before doing an upgrade of a Lino
application on a producton server, always make a snapshot. Yesterday
when doing the release I thought "No need to do a migration" because I
had forgotten about that HelpText table. This table indeed contains no
valuable data, and the web interface showed no problem because that
table is almost never accessed.  But the table name was still
`contenttypes_helptext` while Lino now calls it `gfks_helptext`, and
:cmd:`pm dump2py` was the first who tried to access it. Which was
deemed to fail.  And I had been triaging tickets during at least half
an hour. I'd prefer to not roll back my data to the state before the
release.  How to get out of this lock?  Answer: a new option
`--tolerate` for :cmd:`pm dump2py`.
