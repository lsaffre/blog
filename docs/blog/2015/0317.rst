Worked on :ticket:`38` (Make Lino run with Django 1.7).  Mahmoud and I
had been stuck for a while on a problem problem which occured in Lino
with Django 1.7. Already the `fab initdb` failed with a
ValidationError stating that ``'en'`` were not a valid choice for the
`language` field.

The problem was in :func:`LanguageField
<lino.utils.mldbc.fields.LanguageField>` which was defining the
`choices
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/models/fields/#choices>`__
attribute as follows::

  choices=iter(settings.SITE.LANGUAGE_CHOICES),

The solution was to remove the call to `iter()
<https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#iter>`_ ::

  choices=settings.SITE.LANGUAGE_CHOICES,

I don't remember why I did that `iter()` around
:attr:`LANGUAGE_CHOICES <lino.core.site.Site.LANGUAGE_CHOICES>`.  I
guess that I was worried what happens when :attr:`languages
<lino.core.site.Site.languages>` changes after having defined these
fields.  But for the moment I cannot remember why this should happen.
But the test suite of Lino with Django 1.6 passes, so this change
doesn't break anything.  And thus we can consider the problem as
solved.  Explanation is that "Django 1.7 does some trickery with our
choices, and specifying an iterator over a list instead of the list
itself produces strange behaviour."  This is not a full explanation,
but it is satisfying as long as our solution does not cause any other
problems.
