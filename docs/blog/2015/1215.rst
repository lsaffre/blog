get_default_match() and check_clearings()
=========================================

I continued to work on :ticket:`143`.  

- get_default_match() was not being used for invoices.
- check_clearings() still failed. I did a complete rewrite which maybe
  has much better performance.

Committed my work on Lino, Cosi and Welfare during the last days.
