=====================

The two text fields :attr:`motivation` and :attr:`problems` of
:class:`lino_welfare.chatelet.lib.courses.models.Enrolment`
did not have :attr:`lino.core.fields.RichTextField.textfield_format`
set to `'html'`.


Quand on inscrit une personne à un atelier via l’onglet personne
(courses.EnrolmentsByPupil), il ne s’ajoute pas dans l’onglet O.I.
(courses.BasicEnrolmentsByPupil or 
courses.JobEnrolmentsByPupil)

Miscellaneous changes:

- Discovered and fixed a bug in :mod:`lino.core.choicelists`:
  `ChoiceList.preferred_with`

- SiteAdmin was not Supervisor

- ReceptionClerk did not see the quick action button for reading eID cards


Getting Lino to pass on Travis CI
=================================


Added ``alt="Foo"`` to the input HTML in a doctest snippet of
:mod:`lino.utils.html2xhtml`. It seems that my version of tidylib
added the `alt` attribute even if the input HTML did not specify
it. But the tidylib on Travis CI did *not* add it. Since this subtlety
is not important for Lino, I changed the tested string.
