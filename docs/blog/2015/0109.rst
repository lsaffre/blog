Benutzerprofil "Newcomers" übersetzen nach "Erstempfang"
========================================================

The following fixes :ticket:`54`.

The German translation of the label of the user group "newcomers" is
now "Erstempfang" (instead of
"Neuanträge"). 
:mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.newcomers`
now has an :xfile:`__init__.py`.
Moved some documentation of :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.isip` into the module.


Termin erstellen für Klient ohne Begleitung
===========================================

Working for :ticket:`55`

The :class:`CreateClientVisit
<lino_welfare.modlib.reception.models.CreateClientVisit>` action was
being used only in :class:`reception.Clients
<lino_welfare.modlib.reception.models.Clients>`, now it is injected to
the `pcsw.Client` model (available on every Client table).

It now has a `user_choices` method which currently shows only active
users (non-empty profile). This revealed a bug: defining a chooser on
an action could cause a server-side error message
:message:`AttributeError: 'CreateClientVisit' object has no attribute
'known_values'`.  Added a test to `tests.test_welfare_demo` which
reproduces this error.  Fixed the error by adding `known_values =
None` to :class:`lino.core.utils.Parametrizable`.

I wrote two actions on Client which are supposed to open the calendar
panel, for a user to be selected manually.  When creating an
appointment in that panel, the Client would automatically be set.

One (`find_date_dlg`) is a dialog action where the agent is selected
in a combobox.  But it seems that this combination (dialog action with
JS instead of AJAX call) is not yet possible. So this version is
currently ifed out.  But we might change the False to True because
looking at it helps to imagine how it would look and whether it's
worth to make it possible.

The other implementation (`find_date`) uses a ButtonsTable. It has the
advantage that it works. And in fact I think it is easier to use
because you just click once on the name. Instead of selecting it from
a combobox and then click "Submit".  I am not sure whether this is
still true when there are 30 or 50 users. But we will see.

TODO: after creating an appointment, the client is not automatically
added as a Guest to that appointment.
