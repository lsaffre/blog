- The :attr:`overlap_group
  <lino_welfare.modlib.isip.mixins.ContractTypeBase.overlap_group>`
  field of integration contract types is now allowed to be empty. And
  in that case :class:`OverlappingContractsTest
  <lino_welfare.modlib.isip.mixins.OverlappingContractsTest>` no
  longer warns about overlapping date ranges.  And :meth:`full_clean
  <lino_welfare.modlib.isip.mixins.ContractBase.full_clean>` of a
  contract does not even instantiate an
  :class:`OverlappingContractsTest
  <lino_welfare.modlib.isip.mixins.OverlappingContractsTest>` object.
