With Mathieu: :mod:`setup_auto_event
<lino_welfare.modlib.isip.mixins.ContractBase.setup_auto_event>`
always took the first coaching found, because
:mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.pcsw.models.Client.get_coachings>` ignored
the `period` when there were additional filter parameters.

To understand, fix and test this, I started a new document
:ref:`welfare.tour.autoevents` (using parts from
:ref:`welfare.tested.integ`)

TODO: add screenshots to this document.


With Gerd: There was a bug in
:class:`lino.modlib.addresses.mixins.AddressOwnerChecker`. I extended
:mod:`lino.projects.min2.tests.test_addresses` in order to understand,
fix and test this.

With Pierre: Added new setting :attr:`autorefresh_seconds
<lino.modlib.extjs.Plugin.autorefresh_seconds>`.  Added new button
"refresh" (i.e. a manual refresh without refreshing the browser)
