Testing the fields of form panels
=================================

I added a new chapter :ref:`welfare.specs.eupen` to the functional
specs.  Which required a new function :func:`lino.utils.diag.py2rst`.


How to specify an "or" operation for `required_roles`
=====================================================

I noticed that the test for demo user Theresia (reception clerk) was
being skipped. This made me discover a new trick: how to 
specify an "or" operation for the
:attr:`required_roles
<lino.core.permissions.Permittable.required_roles>`.  

The roles :class:`lino.modlib.office.roles.OfficeOperator` and
:class:`lino.modlib.office.roles.OfficeUser` are *exclusive*: normal
users want either one or the other, but not both. 

For example, a reception clerk is an office *operator*, not
an office *user*. Which means that she does not want to see menu
commands like "My events" or "My visitors".
The social agents are office *users*, not office *operators*. They
want to see what's happening at the reception, but not everything. For
example they don't want to see the :menuselection:`Reception -->
Clients` command because they have their specific commands for that 
(:menuselection:`Integration --> Clients` or
:menuselection:`Debts --> Clients` or
:menuselection:`PCSW --> Clients`).

But then the reception module has certain commands which both
operators and users want to have: for example the global list of
:menuselection:`Reception --> Waiting visitors`.
Actually all reception commands based on
:class:`lino.modlib.reception.models.Visitors`.

See also the source code of :mod:`lino_welfare.projects.std.roles`.
