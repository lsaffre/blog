=================================

Actually I wanted to just work on :ticket:`313` (TinyMCE accepts
editing readonly fields), but I wanted to reproduce the problem
somewhere in Lino and happened to chose :mod:`lino.projects.cms` for
this.  Which made me stumble over a bundle of poorly documented
problems, and I did a little dive in order to fix these.  One of
theese problems is :ticket:`267` (obj2html() in Lino Noi).  It seems
that changing :attr:`root_urlconf <lino.core.site.Site.root_urlconf>`
is no recommended practice because when you have custom urls, then you
also want a custom renderer.
:meth:`lino.core.requests.BaseRequest.get_printable_context` no longer
makes a copy of itself with modified `renderer`, but ``ar`` again
points to the actual request.  To be observed. It seems that the known
problems are fixed. Here be dragons.

I then "fixed" :ticket:`313` by switching
:attr:`lino.modlib.tinymce.Plugin.media_name` back from TinyMCE 3.5.11 to
3.4.8.

A few options of TinyMCE had been hard-coded until now. Now they are
configurable:

- :attr:`window_width <lino.modlib.tinymce.Plugin.window_width>`
- :attr:`window_height <lino.modlib.tinymce.Plugin.window_height>`
- :attr:`field_buttons <lino.modlib.tinymce.Plugin.field_buttons>`
- :attr:`window_buttons1 <lino.modlib.tinymce.Plugin.window_buttons1>`

I also changed the default values for the first two options from
(600, 500) to (500, 400) because on a lower resolution monitor the old
size was too big, which was quite disturbing because there was no way
to close the window.
