Reference to the module's source code
=====================================

Some days ago I thought that the sentence with the reference to the
module's source code (which is added by
:func:`atelier.sphinxconf.base.autodoc_add_srcref`) whould better be
the first sentence of the page because it can be difficult to
find. But now I (re)discovered we we must add it *after* the module
description (not before): it is because also autosummary gets the
docstring processed by this handler.


Upgrade on `demo.lino-welfare.org`
==================================

During a routine upgrade on :ref:`lf` I had a series of error messages
like the following::

  django.db.utils.OperationalError: (1025, "Error on rename of './welfare_chatelet_demo/countries_place' to './welfare_chatelet_demo/#sql2-3bd4-23777' (errno: 152)")

It seems that this might come when tables have different storage
engines, so I changed the system default from MyISAM to InnoDB (see
:ref:`mysql.engine`) in my :file:`/etc/mysql/conf.d/.keepme` file::

    [mysqld]
    # default-storage-engine=myisam
    default-storage-engine=InnoDB

And then I had to `drop` and `create` each concerned database.
