I continued on ticket :ticket:`38` (Make Lino run with Django 1.8).

I renamed `lino.modlib.contenttypes` to :mod:`lino.modlib.gfks`, and
this plugin now has ``django.contrib.contenttypes`` as needed
plugin. This is because Django 1.9 will refuse to import a database
model which is neither abstract nor actually being used::

    RemovedInDjango19Warning: Model class
    django.contrib.contenttypes.models.ContentType doesn't declare an
    explicit app_label and either isn't in an application in
    INSTALLED_APPS or else was imported before its application was
    loaded. This will no longer be supported in Django 1.9.

So in Django 1.9 we cannot extend plain Django plugins like
``django.contrib.contenttypes``. That's okay, and ``contenttypes`` was
the only case. They idea of extending it within the same name was a
bit hackerish anyway.
