Termin erstellen f√ºr Klient ohne Begleitung
===========================================

Working for :ticket:`55`

So yesterday I noticed that after creating an appointment, the client
is not automatically added as a Guest to that appointment.  

The basic problem is in
:meth:`lino.modlib.cal.models_event.Event.suggest_guests`::

    def suggest_guests(self):
        if self.owner:
            for obj in self.owner.suggest_cal_guests(self):
                yield obj

It's not enough to ask only the owner. Manually created events don't
have an owner, but in :ref:`welfare` we have `EventType.invite_client`
which means that the `Event.project` (which always is a Client in
:ref:`welfare`) should be suggested as Guest.
