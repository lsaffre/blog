========================

I started to work on :ticket:`598` (Payment reminders). A first result
came quickly because everything was basicaly ready.

I worked on the `French documentation of Lino Welfare
<http://fr.welfare.lino-framework.org/services.html>`__ as a
preparation for the meeting on Tuesday.  The goal of today's changes
is just to give an idea of what kind of website *I* can provide with
low effort.  The difficulty with this is that I am not a
salesman... also the fact that it is not clear who is "nous" in these
texts. That's because I still don't know what juristic form it will
have.  Probably it will be just a project of Rumma & Ko during the
first year.
