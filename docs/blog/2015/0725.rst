Specs for Ch√¢telet
==================

As a preparation for :ticket:`355` (Release Chatelet 20150726), I
wrote a new document :ref:`welfare.specs.chatelet` for testing the
menus and access permissions for the different fields and panels of
the clients detail window.

Changes en passant: 

- :meth:`lino.core.requests.BaseRequest.show_menu`
  now activates itself the language of the requesting user.

- default `languages` for :mod:`lino_welfare.projects.chatelet` is now
  "fr nl de en" (instead of "en fr nl de" until now).
  Because I noted that Theresia had English as language.


Miscellaneous
=============

- `shotwell2blog.py` now can export tags which contain non-ascii
  characters. At least when your terminal's encoding is utf-8.

- The virtual field :attr:`base_classes
  <lino.modlib.contenttypes.models.ContentTypes.base_classes>` of
  :class:`lino.modlib.contenttypes.models.ContentTypes` caused an
  :ref:`ise` when the database was not synchronized. Fixed.

- Added `tuple` to the list of supported types in
  :func:`lino.core.utils.navinfo` because I had a TypeError
  :message:`count() takes exactly one argument (0 given)` on 
  :class:`lino.modlib.clocking.ui.ReportedProjects`.
