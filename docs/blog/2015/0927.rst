I â™¥ Lino (version 4)
=====================

Here is version 4 of the layout for mugs to be used by people who love
Lino:

.. raw:: html

New font for Lino docs
======================

Version 4 had a side effect: Ly wanted to decide which font fits best
to Lino. She complained that she doesn't like the font used on the
Lino website.  That is all web documents created by Sphinx with the
`alabaster <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/alabaster>`_ theme.  So I
changed the font for both body text and section headers to `Liberation
Sans <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_%28Schriftart%29>`_::

    my_font_family = "Swiss, Helvetica, 'Liberation Sans'"
    html_theme_options = {
        "font_family": my_font_family,
        "head_font_family": my_font_family,
    }
    
Another candidate was `DejaVu Sans <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DejaVu>`_.
