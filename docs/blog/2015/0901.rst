==========================

I activated `ledger`, `finan` and `vatless` for
:mod:`lino_welfare.projects.eupen` and released this to their
production site. Which means that the first prototype of :ticket:`143`
will become visible.

Theoretically this change should not affect any existing user profiles
except `SiteAdmin`. But in practice it did: most actors in these
modules did not yet have their `required_roles` set.

I used the following script to load
:mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.ledger.fixtures.std` into their database::

    from lino_welfare.modlib.ledger.fixtures.std import objects
    for obj in objects():
        obj.full_clean()
        obj.save()
