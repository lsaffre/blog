#596 : Split lino_cosi.lib.sepa into "sepa_out" and "sepa_in"
=============================================================

New :ticket:`596`.  I realized that we will need to split the
:mod:`lino_cosi.lib.sepa` module.  One part of it is just the fact of
maintaining a list of bank accounts of your business partners:
`Account` and `AccountsByPartner`.  The second part is about importing
data from the bank and having statements and movements on these
accounts. This is used only by :ref:`welfare`. In :ref:`cosi` we do
not want this functionality.  Another functionality (yet to write) is
that Lino sends payment orders to the bank.


Continued with tim2lino
=======================

Note: I have two tickets :ticket:`353` (Umstieg von TIM nach Lino) and
:ticket:`554` (first usage of tim2lino) which are partially redundant.
353 is declared as "depends on 554".

That customer currently uses TIM since A.D. 2000. The first two years
are still in BEF as currency before they switched to EUR. We decieded
that we can ignore these first two years when importing data to
Lino. Lino does not yet support multiple currencies, and for the
moment there is no user who might be interested in that feature, so
that task is sleeping.

The :mod:`tim2lino <lino_cosi.lib.tim2lino.fixtures.tim2lino>` fixture
now ignores everything before 2002.

Still thinking about whether Matching.match should be a ForeignKey or
a CharField. I am far from being sure whether my thoughts on
:doc:`0929` were right. Currently I believe again that a CharField is
better...

Printing a sales invoice produced an empty document. Mainly because
the model name has chaged (to :class:`VatProductInvoice
<lino_cosi.lib.sales.models.VatProductInvoice>`) some long time ago,
but I forgot to also rename the :xfile:`config` directory with the
template.

TODO:

- Print a payment reminder

- Two failures of the Cosi test suite (in `docs/tested/demo.rst` and
  `docs/tested/ledger.rst`) are failing due to my changes.


The navigation bar is back

Thanks to `Jeff McKenna who reacted to my post

I "fixed" :ticket:`550` (though not in an elegant way).
