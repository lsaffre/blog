Working on :ticket:`95`.

:meth:`lino.core.actions.Action.is_window_action`

In :mod:`lino.modlib.about` I functionally replaced
:class:`DetailLayouts` by :class:`WindowActions`. The latter is more
complete since it includes insert layouts and action parameter
layouts.

:meth:`lino.core.layouts.BaseLayout.get_layout_handle` no longer
expects an argument because anyway this argument was not used.
