=========================

The last thing I did yesterday before going to sleep was to upgrade
:ref:`lf`. Which revealed that :ref:`faggio` was still broken.

I worked on :doc:`/tutorials/tables/index`.

I renamed :mod:`lino.core.site_def` to :mod:`lino.core.site`.

Fixed a typo bug in
:meth:`lino.utils.sendchanges.Emitter.emit_created` which caused a
TypeError :message:`format() argument after ** must be a mapping, not
type` (ticket :ticket:`69`).

Added more content to :doc:`/tutorials/sendchanges/index` in order to
cover this.

Added a new rule to facilitate above test case: remote authentication
is now activated also if :attr:`lino.core.site.Site.default_user` is
nonempty but :attr:`lino.core.site.Site.remote_user_header` has been
left empty. In that case ever request becomes default_user.
