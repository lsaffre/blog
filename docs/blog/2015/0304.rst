Please specify a doctor type
============================

When inserting a :class:`aids.RefundConfirmation
<lino_welfare.modlib.aids.RefundConfirmation>`: Lino now says
:message:`Please specify a doctor type` ("Bitte geben Sie die Art des
Arztes an") if user leaves both doctor and doctor_type blank (instead
of raising an `IntegrityError` :message:`(1048, "Column
'doctor_type_id' cannot be null")`).



'Role' object has no attribute 'language'
=========================================

If the recipient of an aid confirmation is a
:class:`lino.modlib.contacts.models.Role`, Lino no longer raises an
AttributeError "'Role' object has no attribute 'language'"


Combinations of two
===================

I started to work on :ticket:`118`. The first part is a general
problem: how to find duplicate persons in a database.  This is done by
`lino.modlib.dedupe`, but until now it was just a proof of concept
which needed to be optimized. That's done now. See
:ref:`welfare.tested.dupe_clients`.

Side effects:

- not only persons but all partners
- uses a new database field phonetic_name
- Use a model mixin and override full_clean.

This is an example case where Django's signals would cause a lot of
trouble and hacking while overriding a model mixin and full_clean is
elegant.

The optimized algorithem uses *combinations*:

>>> from itertools import combinations
>>> [''.join(c) for c in combinations(['a', 'b'], 2)]
['ab']
>>> [''.join(c) for c in combinations(['a', 'b', 'c'], 2)]
['ab', 'ac', 'bc']
>>> [''.join(c) for c in combinations(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], 2)]
['ab', 'ac', 'ad', 'bc', 'bd', 'cd']


Lino and Django 1.7
===================

Mahmoud correctly `discovered
<http://iamdevops.com/blog/2015/0303.html>`_ Daniel's blog entry about
`how to get rid of the warning "1_6.W001"
<http://daniel.hepper.net/blog/2014/04/fixing-1_6-w001-when-upgrading-from-django-1-5-to-1-7/>`_.
Added a :setting:`TEST_RUNNER` setting to
:mod:`lino.projects.std.settings`.
