'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get_detail_action'
======================================================

A surprise in the morning: I wanted to start working, but my Noi told
me above error message. The traceback showed that it came from the
following line of code (in
:func:`lino.modlib.stars.models.welcome_messages`)::

    chunks += join_elems([ar.obj2html(obj.owner) for obj in qs])

Explanation: Yesterday I had created duplicate tickets 348 and 349 due
to bug #219.  I had already starred ticket 348 before noticing that it
was duplicated.  Then I deleted it. Lino did not delete the
:class:`Star <lino.modlib.stars.models.Star>` object -and did not
refuse to delete the starred ticket- because
:attr:`controller_is_optional
<lino.modlib.contenttypes.mixins.Controllable.controller_is_optional>`
on :class:`Star <lino.modlib.stars.models.Star>` was at its default
value `True`.  Since this traceback happened while building
:xfile:`admin_main.html`, the web interface was not usable.  Here is
the little script which I used to repair the database and get it back
to work::

    from lino.api.shell import *
    qs = stars.Star.objects.filter(owner_type__isnull=True)
    print [obj.owner for obj in qs]  # []
    qs = stars.Star.objects.all()
    #print qs
    #print [obj.owner_type for obj in qs]
    print [obj.owner for obj in qs]
    a = [obj for obj in qs if obj.owner is None]
    assert len(a) == 1
    a = a[0]
    print a.owner, a.owner_type, a.owner_id
    a.delete()

The bug was not abovementioned line of text but the fact that the
:attr:`owner <lino.modlib.stars.models.Star.owner>` field was
optional.


Optimizing :mod:`lino.utils.html2rst`
=============================================================

Continued with :ticket:`351`: repair test suites and 
optimize :mod:`lino.utils.html2rst`.
