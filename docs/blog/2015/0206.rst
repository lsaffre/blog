Job supplying
=============

The new module :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.art61` solves ticket
:ticket:`84`.


I replaced the word "job supply" by either "job supplyment" (a
contract) or "job supplying" (the act of).

I discovered that `mi-is.be
<http://www.mi-is.be/be-fr/cpas/article-61>`_ uses the expression
"employment assignment" for translating "mise au travail".

It seems that "Mise Ã  l'emploi" is newer and more correct than "Mise
au travail", but the latter is still frequently used.

Job provider = Job supplier

The problem I had some days ago with generating demo data for the
immersion module is now fixed by
:mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.integ.fixtures.demo`.
