=========================

I started to work on :ticket:`363` and used that occasion to optimize
the API for defining filter parameters: added a new method
:meth:`get_simple_parameters
<lino.core.model.Model.get_simple_parameters>`. This method is now
preferred over the :attr:`simple_parameters
<lino.core.model.Model.simple_parameters>` attribute because it
enables us to write inheritage cascades.  And it can be defined either
on the model or on the table.

Added some first test cases for filter parameters to
:ref:`welfare.specs.aids`.  Added two virtual fields "Number of
adults" and "Number of children".
