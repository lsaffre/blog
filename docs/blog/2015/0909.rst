A scrambled SEPA file
=====================

Working on :ticket:`505`.

I wrote a new demo fixture
:mod:`lino_cosi.lib.sepa.fixtures.sample_ibans`.

Here is a script to be executed with :manage:`run` which scrambles a
SEPA file of bank statements:

.. literalinclude:: 0908_scramble_sepa_stmt.py

What it does:

- replace all IBANs by fictive IBANS from
  :mod:`lino_cosi.lib.sepa.fixtures.sample_ibans`
- replace all names of recipients by fictive names from a Lino demo database


AttributeError: type object 'Model' has no attribute '_meta'
============================================================

Discovered bug :ticket:`516`, wrote a test case (in a new document
:ref:`lino.tested.gfks`), fixed the bug.
