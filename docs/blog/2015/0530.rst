After abandoning yesterday, I sent a help request to the sphinx-users
group and a few hours later Takayuki sent the solution. Here is what I
need to put into my :file:`.static/myalabaster.css` file::

    /* override alabaster setting */
    div.related {
        display: block;
    }

The relevant source files used to generate this blog are available
under :srcref:`docs/.static/myalabaster.css` and
:srcref:`docs/.templates/layout.html`.
