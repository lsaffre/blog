Sozialsekretariat
=================

I finished yesterdays work and checked them in.  Welfare test suite is
still a bit broken, but I leave that for later since there will be
more changes soon.

One change of the :ticket:`143` project is that we have now two
accounting charts in one application. That's new, and it reveals that
accounting charts should rather be choicelists (stored in the
application code) than model instances (stored in the database):
:class:`lino.modlib.accounts.choicelists.AccountCharts`.


Wikimedia Foundation Elections 2015
===================================

I gave my vote for the `Wikimedia Foundation Elections 2015
<https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation_elections/Board_elections/2015>`_
(though I am definitively underinformed about the topic and act based
on pure intuition).

One of the guys I gave my preference is `Dariusz Jemielniak
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dariusz_Jemielniak>`, partly for his
post `Wikipedia, a Professor's Best Friend
<https://chronicle.com/article/Wikipedia-a-Professors-Best/149337>`_
(note the discussion with people like couchloc or Gregory Kohs).
