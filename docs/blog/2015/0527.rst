=======================

Continued on :ticket:`143`.  First modules
:mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.ledger` and :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.finan`
show that I don't need to worry about :ticket:`246` for the moment.

There was a problem :ticket:`284` (ar.show() renders to console and
not to document) which intrigued me some time.  One reaction was that
I moved the :meth:`get_printable_context` method from
:class:`lino.core.site.Site` to
:class:`lino.core.requests.BaseRequest`, and the
:class:`get_printable_context
<lino.core.model.Model.get_printable_context>` on a model instance now
gets the action request `ar` as mandatory positional argument.

While this was nice, it did not bring a solution.

The solution was to remove the following usage example from the
docstring of :meth:`lino.core.requests.BaseRequest.show`::

    do text
    from html(ar.show('auth.UsersOverview'))

This example had worked once, but broke some time ago.  And I
meanwhile think that it was not a good idea.  Rendering a table into
an `appy.pod` template is done using the `table` function defined by
:class:`lino.utils.appy_pod.Renderer`::

    do text
    from table(ar.spawn('auth.UsersOverview'))

All this should be documented somewhere below :lino:`Printing
documents </dev/printing>`.

The `ar` in an `appy.pod` template represents the action request which
asked for building the document. This request can have either a html
renderer or a console renderer.
