New body template :xfile:`courses/Enrolment/enrolment.body.html`

Added a fixture which creates the corresponding excerpt type in the
demo database.

:class:`lino.modlib.courses.models.Enrolment` is now
:class:`lino.modlib.excerptsd.mixins.Certifiable`.

ExcerptType.update_for_model no longer saves itself the object but
returns it. Adapted the fixtures which use this method.
