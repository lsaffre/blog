=========================

For :ticket:`639` I did more work than usual: 

- I added a :cmd:`pm run` script :mod:`scramble_tx25
  <lino_welfare.projects.eupen.scramble_tx25>`. This was the most
  difficult part. The advantage is that it will help me to grow our
  library of Tx25 example which contained only 2 files.

- I added a new fictive Tx25 response :file:`demo_tx25_3.xml` to
  :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.cbss.fixtures.cbss_demo` which reproduces
  the problem.

- I added another :cmd:`pm run` script :mod:`print_tx25
  <lino_welfare.projects.eupen.print_tx25>` which is convenient when
  you are debugging a new handler and want to see the result without
  using the mouse.

- I wrote the handler for `PostalAddressAbroad` to
  :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.cbss.tx25`.  This was the actual problem
  and took just a few minutes.

- TODO: the test suite currently does not yet print these Tx25
  automatically and therefore does not actually detect whether there
  is a problem.
