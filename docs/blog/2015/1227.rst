Hamza is advancing on :ticket:`37`.  He submitted `pull request #14
<https://github.com/lino-framework/lino_extjs6/pull/14>`_ which I now merged
into the master of :mod:`lino_extjs6`.  One of the fixed problems is
:message:`Ext.ComponentManager.register(): Registering duplicate
component id "undefined-paging-toolbar"`, which he fixed (as described
in `Sencha forum
<https://www.sencha.com/forum/showthread.php?303101>`_) by including
code taken from the `ComboBoxPickerId.js
<https://github.com/JarvusInnovations/sencha-hotfixes/blob/ext/6/0/0/640/overrides/form/field/ComboBoxPickerId.js>`_
file, which is part of `jarvus-hotfixes
<https://github.com/JarvusInnovations/sencha-hotfixes/tree/master>`_
and licensed MIT.

I added a documentation tree to the :mod:`lino_extjs6` repo and
published it at http://extjs6.lino-framework.org/
