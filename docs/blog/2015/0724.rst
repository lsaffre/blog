Finished :ticket:`351`
======================

Uff, I finally finished the adaptions to the test suite after
:ticket:`351` (must add that Gerd and Aur√©lie are visiting us, so I
have not much time in front of my computer).


New fablib command `cd`

I wrote a command :command:`fab cd` that generates a list of all the
commits in all my projects for a given day:
