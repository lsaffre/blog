=======================

I stumbled over `this
<http://www.embedded.com/electronics-blogs/open-mike/4440107/Free-Software-Foundation-vs-Microsoft>`_
and could not refrain from reacting to it in :doc:`/topics/why_free`.

I had almost two days of rest from Lino.  When you start a new week
after such a long time, then it is good to have a detailed to-do
list. And :class:`TicketsToDo <lino.modlib.tickets.ui.TicketsToDo>` is
*almost* good. Two checkins with several optimizations (e.g. new field
:attr:`waiting_for <lino.modlib.tickets.models.Ticket.waiting_for>`),
one bugfix (:ticket:`433`) and a new test case
(:mod:`lino.projects.min2.tests.test_cal`).
