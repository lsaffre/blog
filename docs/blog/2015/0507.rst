Fixed a bug which caused a message "ContentType has no attribute
'delete_veto_message').

Worked on new ticket :ticket :`188` (printing an art61 contract).

The fields `company`, `contact_person` and `contact_role` are usually
copied to every excerpt of a `ContactRelated`. An application can now
decide to *not* do this. Usage case is
:mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.art61.models.Contract`.

In a appy pod template, if you have both a ``do text if`` and a ``do
text from`` comment in a same paragrap, then the ``do text from`` must
come first.
