=============================================
Write a Lino for real estate agents (brokers)
=============================================

Friday, September 2, 2022

I had a meeting with a friend who works as a professional broker. In Estonia
there are ca 3 major platforms for real estate offers, but none of them is free.
A Lino application would make sense, but only at international level and only
long-term. No immediate investors at the horizon.

I created :ticket:`4637` and started to think about it.

Trading real estate objects is not the same as managing them. So this Lino would
be for brokers (`kinnisvaramaakler
<https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinnisvaramaakler>`__), not for homeowner
associations (`korteri√ºhistu
<https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korteri%C3%BChistu>`__). OTOH there will be
common vocabulary with a application for homeowner associations, and there might
be another Lino for homeowner associations as well. So the name "Lino Immo"
would be biased.

It would define a series of new product types, each of them would inherit from
:class:`lino_xl.lib.products.Product` and from
:class:`lino_xl.lib.countries.AddressLocation`. Journals would be rental offers,
sales offers, rental contracts, sales contracts, and maybe more.
