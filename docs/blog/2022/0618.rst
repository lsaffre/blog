First use case: a sales note is being paid cash immediately. We don't know
anything about the customer.

=========================== ======== ========= ==========
Account                     Debit    Credit    Partner
=========================== ======== ========= ==========
701000 sales of goods        100€
570000 cash                              100 €
=========================== ======== ========= ==========

Second case: client pays with credit card or online payment. Here we know the
partner (at least his card number), and the API communication with the bank has
been done during :meth:`register`.

=========================== ======== ========= ==========
Account                     Debit    Credit    Partner
=========================== ======== ========= ==========
701000 sales of goods          100 €
400000 clients receivable                100 € somebody
400000 clients receivable      100 €           somebody
570100 credit card payments              100 €
=========================== ======== ========= ==========

Third case. The payment fails. We say "Okay, take your goods and we trust you to
come back tomorrow and pay in cash".  Just set payment method to "invoice". Lino
should book this:

=========================== ======== ========= ==========
Account                     Debit    Credit    Partner
=========================== ======== ========= ==========
701000 sales of goods          100 €
400000 clients receivable                100 € somebody
=========================== ======== ========= ==========

When the customer returns later the same day and pays cash, we register a
"payment without sale". This is just a sales note without any product. Lino
should automatically show in the :attr:`balance_before` virtual field. And since
there are no items, the :attr:`balance_to_pay` will be the same.

=========================== ======== ========= ==========
Account                     Debit    Credit    Partner
=========================== ======== ========= ==========
400000 clients receivable      100 €           somebody
570000 cash payment                      100 €
=========================== ======== ========= ==========

If the client forgets to return and to pay, we will automatically issue an
invoice.
