==========================
Which IM client to use?
==========================

Friday, September 16, 2022

Sharif and I have been using Discord for quite some time. Because it simply
works. Jitsi didn't always work well. And then Jitsi has no history at all of
our chat messages. We know that Discord is non-free. It is a compromise. Now it
seems that screen-sharing doesn't work any more on Discord with my new computer.
Rather than investing time into a non-free software, I thought that we should
give `Signal <https://www.signal.org>`__ a try.
