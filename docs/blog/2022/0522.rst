About site features
===================

- we leave the translatable text in the code. Because that makes sense. A one-sentence short desciption.

- we add a convention: when you develop a feature, then you are responsible for
  also providing a ``ref`` name to that feature in the users guide.

- Example: the :ref:`third_party_authentication
  <ug.plugins.users.third_party_authentication>` feature is bla blabla

The site features are needed in the About window only so that an :term:`end
user`, when reporting some problem, can can easily report which features they
have activated on their site

A list of all available features is needed for a :term:`site operator` who wants
to check which features they want and which the don't want. This list can be
either in the :term:`local help pages` or in the application's user guide (or
both). Anyway these are static Sphinx docs. The one-line descriptions of each
feature are needed when generating such an overview page.


TODO (Sharif):

- The About window should just show a one-paragraph list of the enabled site
  features. Only the internal names, not even clickable.

TODO (Luc):

- The :manage:`makedocs` command can generate what is currently being shown in
  the about window. Maybe as a list instead of a table.


Examples: :setting:`notify.remove_after` is a :term:`plugin setting`.
