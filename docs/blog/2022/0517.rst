=================================
Presenting Lino to my future boss
=================================

Tuesday, May 17, 2022

Tonight I plan to attend :doc:`once more </blog/2021/0520>` to HackerX, an event
where developers can enter for free because they are actually what is being sold
to the customers. The customers are companies in search of new human resources.
I probably don't fit into their standard product pattern but they did let me in.
Nice.

Here is my self-presentation:

  Developer skills: Linux, Python, Django, Sphinx, Git, React.  Long-term
  experience in accounting, team management, sales agreements, website
  authoring.

  I am patiently looking forward to meeting my future boss and employer.

  With me you get a functioning community of 3 workers and 20 customers.
  I am the author and maintainer of the :ref:`Lino framework <lf>`. I am CEO and
  co-owner of :ref:`rumma`. I am employing other developers since 2015 (see `my
  team page <https://www.saffre-rumma.net/team/>`__). I have been working on
  this :ref:`vision <lino.vision>` my whole life. I am not going to stop working
  on it.

  But Rumma & Ko is willing to subdue all this to someone who does what I am
  less good at: bringing this community to the next level. Of course our
  customers and employees will have their voice in any agreement.
