.. currentmodule:: lino.utils.code

In :mod:`lino.utils.code` I changed :func:`codefiles` function to search the
file system for source files. So the :func:`analyze_rst` now gives useful
results.

Seems that the text "optional arguments:" generated by the ``--help`` of
``optparse`` has been changed to "options:" between Python 3.9 and Python 3.10.
Causes two failures.
