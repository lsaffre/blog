I think I will reactivate :ticket:`1516` in favour of :ticket:`4427`.

- :ticket:`3004` Replace "Reference tickets" by "Starred tickets"?
- :ticket:`4427` A "nicknames" plugin
- :ticket:`1516` Add a "parent" field to ticket
- :ticket:`2384` Kanban for Jane


:ticket:`4427` has at least two disadvantages: Adds complexity. Can be replaced
by a list of recently active tickets. Requires every user to maintain their
nicknames.

:ticket:`1516` says "I seem to remember that I had this in the ticketing system
in TIM, and  that I deliberately decided to drop this, because it caused
problems for reporting. Until now tickets are designed to be "atomic" units for
project management." but I doubt whether problems for reporting still holds.
Yes, reporting becomes more complex because the client will want to see a
summary of all their top-level tickets, together with the sum of invested time
(including time on child tickets), but that's not a problem in an SQL database.

One advantage of :ticket:`1516` would be that top-level tickets would be the
"goals" of a Kanban board and that we can easily convert any ticket into a
top-level ticket (or the opposite: convert a top-level ticket to a child of
another ticket)
