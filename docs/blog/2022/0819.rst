I sent an email to Martin Leblanc, the author and maintainer of  the `PyVAT
<https://github.com/iconfinder/pyvat>`__ package, asking him about his
plans regarding pyvat.

The pyvat project has been forked 27 times (`source
<https://github.com/iconfinder/pyvat/network/members>`__). Most of these forks
don't add anything, except for the following ones:

- https://github.com/Alex-Espressone/pyvat
  is 1 commit ahead, 73 commits behind iconfinder:master.

- https://github.com/jbma/pyvat
  is 6 commits ahead, 97 commits behind iconfinder:master.
