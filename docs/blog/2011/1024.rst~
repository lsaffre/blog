New documentation page :doc:`/davlink/index`.

Tried to apply a public CACert certificate for the `DavLink.jar`
so that users know whom to trust when adding their security exception.

- Opened account on www.cacert.org
- Created new client certificate
- Installed into FF from link provided by www.cacert.org
- Exported from FF as file t:\data\luc\cacert\CAcertWoTUser.crt
  using Certificate Manager (:menuselection:`Options --> 
  Advanced --> Encryption --> Your Certificates --> 
  View --> Details --> Export`
- Imported into java keystore using::

    keytool -import -file t:\data\luc\cacert\CAcertWoTUser.crt -alias luc -trustcacerts
    
No success yet. Difficult to document. Here are some notes::
    

  jarsigner: Certificate chain not found for: luc.  luc must reference a valid KeyStore key entry containing a private key and corresponding public key certificate chain.    


  T:\hgwork\lino\java>keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore t:\data\luc\cacert\luc.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12
  Enter destination keystore password:
  Enter source keystore password:
  Entry for alias cacert wot user's root ca id successfully imported.
  Import command completed:  1 entries successfully imported, 0 entries failed or cancelled

  keytool -changealias -alias "cacert wot user's root ca id" -destalias luc


  Warning:
  The signer certificate's ExtendedKeyUsage extension doesn't allow code signing.
  The signer certificate will expire within six months.
  The signer's certificate chain is not validated.
