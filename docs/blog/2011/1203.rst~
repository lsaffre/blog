After playing around with Lino's new calendar panel,
I get the feeling that I don't want the preliminary EventEditWindow 
with the "Edit Details..." button. 

After looking at the Ext.ensible code, 
and after reading Brians posts in the Ext.ensible forum
(`here <http://ext.ensible.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=421>`_
and
`there <http://ext.ensible.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=326#p1165>`_),
it seems that I must replace
`Ext.ensible.cal.EventEditWindow`, 
not 
`Ext.ensible.cal.EventEditForm`.

That means that I'd better also remove my WindowWrapper classes 
which became almost useless anyway. 
That would replace 

::

  Lino.thirds.ThirdsByOwner.grid = function(caller,params) { 
    var ww = new Lino.GridMasterWrapper(caller,{  });
    params.containing_window = ww;
    var main_grid5470 = new Lino.thirds.ThirdsByOwner.GridPanel(params);
    ww.main_item = main_grid5470;
    ww.show();
  };

  Lino.thirds.ThirdsByOwner.grid = function(caller,params) { 
    new Lino.Window({
      items:new Lino.thirds.ThirdsByOwner.GridPanel(params)
    }).show();
  };


New tutorial
------------

Started new tutorial :doc:`/tutorials/t3`.

The new method :meth:`lino.Lino.get_middleware_classes` is there to support 
sites without any user management by setting :attr:`lino.Lino.user_model` 
to `None`.

Some changes to support the case of :attr:`lino.Lino.user_model` 
being `None` on a real site.
