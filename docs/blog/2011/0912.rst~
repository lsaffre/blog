========

The following two changes came because it took me a rather long time 
to understand why the Detail of the new :model:`dsbe.jobs.Offer` model 
complained about not finding the `jobs.PersonsByOffer` 
slave report. Explanation that this was called 
`contacts.PersonsByOffer` according to my own rules established 
:blogref:`20110822`.

The `app_label` of a Report
---------------------------

I changed (again) the rules for setting the `app_label` 
of a Report:

The default value (which should be used in most cases) is 
the "application" where the Report is defined. 
For example it's now 
`dsbe.MyPersons` and not `contacts.MyPersons`,
`dsbe.LinksByPerson` and not `links.LinksByPerson`,
`lino.ContentTypes` and not `contenttypes.ContentTypes`...

Enhanced the message of the exception risen when an unknown 
element name is found in a :xfile:`.dtl` file: it also now 
tells us the possible values, including slave reports.


`makedocs` got better
---------------------

:mod:`lino.management.commands.makedocs` 
got a bit better. 
The result is at 
:doc:`/dsbe/appdocs`
and
:doc:`/igen/appdocs`
(but is not yet production ready).
