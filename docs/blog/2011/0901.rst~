========

I imagined a new method to test whether a data migration worked correctly.
Because I'm fascinated about how well 
my :doc:`dpy fixtures </topics/dpy>` work,
I wrote a new section about this in :doc:`/admin/datamig` 

One detail came up while exploring this method:
models that used :class:`lino.mixins.CreatedModified` 
did show differences because their `modified` field gets 
touched when the fixture is being loaded.
This was because of Djangos `auto_now 
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.DateField.auto_now>`_
option on that field.

That's why we now handle this in a overridden save() method (touching the field only if 
:attr:`lino.Lino.loading_from_dump` is `False`.
