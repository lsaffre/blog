Tutorial
--------

I wrote a first tutorial ":doc:`/tutorials/t1`".

Fixed some minor bugs that appeared for this. 
For example one problem was that `SiteConfig.dtl` wanted a `site_company` field
even though `lino.modlib.contacts` wasn't installed.

Test `tim2lino.act`
-------------------

This is specific to a customer who wants to be able to trigger a 
full synchronisation from TIM to Lino.
