Still worked the whole day on the internal changes which I started 
a week ago in order to integrate the Ext.ensible Calendar Panel.

Today was a typical ExtJS problem: 
I called 
`Window.setTitle()` 
The DOM element got updated, but the Eindow's new 
header text didn't appear on screen. 
And when inspecting the element with FireBug or Chrome Development Console, 
the updated content *was* there.
Very puzzling.
The explanation seems to be: I'm calling `Window.setTitle()` 
*during* rendering 
(while the Window or part of it's components were still being rendered).
The `rendered` flag was already `true`, but if you look at the code of `Ext.Component.render` 
you see that a lot of things still happen afterwards.
I lazily worked around this by using `defer`.


Updated installation docs

No, a Linux server is not required in order to see Lino. 
Wrote new article :doc:`/admin/install_windows`.
