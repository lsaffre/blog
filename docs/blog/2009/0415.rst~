20090415 non-serializing fixtures
---------------------------------

Django is great! It took me less than 2 hours to write a solution for
Django Ticket `#10664 <http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/10664>`_!

The ticket is marked "Design decision needed", 
but my proposed solution doesn't require any Django patch. 
It uses the fact that Django lets you declare your own 
Serializers.

See :doc:`/topics/dpy` for an overview.
