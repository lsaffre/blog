20090415 non-serializing fixtures
---------------------------------

Django is great! It took me less than 2 hours to write a solution for
Django Ticket :djangoticket:`10664`!

The ticket is marked "Design decision needed",
but my proposed solution doesn't require any Django patch.
It uses the fact that Django lets you declare your own
Serializers.

See :lino:`/topics/dpy` for an overview.
