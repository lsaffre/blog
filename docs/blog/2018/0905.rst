Haha! The new implementation of accounting reports as a user plan
works!

Pitfall : The StartPlan action is instantiated only once: on the
UserPlan mixin.  This single action instance gets attached to several
actors, with one BoundAction instance for each of them.
As a consequence we cannot use :meth:`attach_to_actor`.

I reviewed the documentation about actions, mostly converting back the
attribute docstrings from prose style to the code.  The
:mod:`lino.core.actions` module is not a plugin and therefore *should*
have API reference documentation generated by autodoc.  The
:ref:`dev.actions` page in contrast should be a comprehensive topic
overview.


:attr:`lino.mixins.ref.Referrable.ref_max_length` was being ignored
when setting the max_length ot the ref field because the field is
being defined on the mixin, and at this moment is not visible whether
a subclass overrides it.  Anyway it is better to have the database
definition of this field with a constant max_length.  Until now all
:attr:`ref` fields or Referrable models have a max_length of 40 (which
was the value of :attr:`Referrable.ref_max_length
<lino.mixins.ref.Referrable.ref_max_length>`).  I changed that value
to 200.

I removed the `ana.Group` model.
