dead keys sometimes don't work in PyCharm
=========================================

I added my comment to their existing ticket:
https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-149815

I continued to work on :ticket:`2687`.  The release notes Welfare FR
:ref:`welcht.18.12.0` are now public.
Seems that the summary for UploadsByClient doesn't work. :ticket:`2721`.

A side effect of :ticket:`2723`. When separating welcht from the general lino
welfare site I forgot to take the :meth:`setup_plugins` method. As a
consequence :attr:`lino_xl.lib.clients.Plugin.client_model` was not set
correctly. To understand what was going on, I had to extend the assertion
message issued by :meth:`lino.utils.memo.Parser.register_django_model` when an
application tries to redefine another renderer on the same model.
