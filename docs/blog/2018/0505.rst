=====================

I have at least 3 projects with paying customers waiting for progress.
And instead of working on these projects I worked during a full week
on the "Get the Lino projects to pass on Travis" site, a background
job for which no customer will pay a cent because it doesn't give them
any tangible result.  I'd fully agree if somebody who follows my
activities would tell me that I am crazy...

But also today I continued with this.  Because now it's almost done,
and now *I want to* have it done.

AttributeError: 'bool' object has no attribute 'model'
======================================================

The :ref:`welfare` project on :ref:`travis` is still failing in
Python 3.  Here is one traceback::
