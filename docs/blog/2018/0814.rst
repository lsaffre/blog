Optimizations in Lino Tera
==========================

create purchase invoice:

- change partner --> vat_regime and account should change
- partners having a purchase_account or not
- partners with different vat regimes

  

  

OpenUI5 bee-day
===============

I added a new site attribute :attr:`lino.core.site.Site.device_type`.

But actually we still have no answer to the question Why does the
server need to know the device type?

We have the table's
mobile_columns
tablet_columns and
popin_columns.
