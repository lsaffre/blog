TeamViewer says "Not Ready. Please check your connection"

And indeed it seems that teamviewer.com no longer exists::           


    $ ping teamviewer.com
    ping: teamviewer.com: Name or service not known


Excerpt from my :file:`TeamViewer13_Logfile.log`::

My problem is that neither Johanna in Eupen nor Hamza in Douz 
have the same problem.
So I guess it is a DNS issue.
Some DNS server between me and the teamviewer.com server giving some wrong information.
And indeed, after half an hour the problem vanished by itself.
