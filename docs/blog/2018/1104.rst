========================

I finished working on :ticket:`2579` and wrote :ref:`tera.18.11.0`.

I finished the new testing environment for weleup.
:ticket:`2620`

Upgrade instruction for :ref:`welfare` after
:ticket:`2622` (Move welfare specs from welfare to book):
In your local :xfile:`settings.py`, you must change::

  from lino_welfare.projects.eupen.settings import *

to::  

  from lino_welfare.eupen.settings import *
        

How to undo a git pull
======================

Today I accidentally did a :xfile:`pull.sh` in a production
environment::

    $ ./pull.sh 
    /usr/local/django/testlino/env/repositories/lino /usr/local/django/testlino

    ^C

To undo it, I used :cmd:`git reset --hard` as follows::

    $ git reset --hard a7c6b7b

But how did I know the commit hash there, a7c6b7b?  It was lucky
because I had noticed my mistake before the terminal output had gone
away from my screen buffer.  So I could see::

    Updating a7c6b7b..303b892

In order to be more fool-proof, :xfile:`pull.sh` should log the HEAD's
commit hash for every repository.
