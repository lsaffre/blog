======================

I did several releases to Jane and some optimizations:

I removed `project` and `topic` from
:class:`lino_xl.lib.tickets.RefTickets` and added `site`.
I reactivated :class:`lino_xl.lib.tickets.PublicTickets`.


I would like to be able to record some of my daily activities more
accurately, but I often do things "for which there is no ticket".  I
don't want to invoice them, just record them and maybe later assign
them to some ticket.  In a first attempt I changed
:attr:`lino_xl.lib.working.Session.ticket` to nullable, but then undid
that change because it would require more code changes to test for an
empty ticket of a session and because this doesn't seem a good
solution.

Maybe rather a notion of `default_ticket` for unclassified sessions?
But where to put that field?  If I simply inject a field
`default_ticket` to User, we have a circular reference when dumping
which might increase restore time or even cause deadlocks (if the
author of a ticket selects this ticket as its default_ticket).  Or per
site subscription?  Or a list of recently used tickets? No, because
this would require me to choose a site before starting a session.  So
it seems that the best solution is a field in the global
:class:`lino.modlib.system.SiteConfig`. One default ticket for all
users.  Why not. To be meditated.  :ticket:`2430`.
