I continue to work at full speed for :ref:`tera`.

Oops, when opening the detail of a client with topics, I had a
:message:`ValueError: All strings must be XML compatible: Unicode or
ASCII, no NULL bytes or control characters`.  This happened because I
passed something else than a string as second argument to
:meth:`obj2html <lino.core.requests.BaseRequest.obj2html>` (in
:mod:`lino_xl.lib.topics`)::

    @classmethod
    def summary_row(cls, ar, obj, **kwargs):
        if ar is None:
            yield six.text_type(obj.topic)
        else:
            yield ar.obj2html(obj, six.text_type(obj.topic))

I have to adapt the test suites after my changes.  Travis helps me
