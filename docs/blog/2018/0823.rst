I did a set of optimizations in the partner layouts of :ref:`tera`.


Abdelkader is working on his `Warehouse application
<https://github.com/kaderdevlino/lino-framework-demo01>`__ and asked
two good questions.  As a first short answer, I will just point to
some existing documentation pages:

- firstly how we make quickly a link from homepage to a table (or
  database we have it)
  
  --> You have three easy possibilities: you can define quick links,
  welcome messages or dashboard items.  See :ref:`dev.admin_main`,
  :ref:`specs.dashboard` and maybe :ref:`dev.menu`.
  
- secondly is i want a simple user per example to show only one table
  not the others,how we make it also quickly
  
  --> For this you need to understand Lino's approach for user
  permissions. See :ref:`dev.permissions`, and maybe
  :ref:`specs.users` and :ref:`dev.users`.
