I committed a series of changes for :ref:`tera` :ref:`tera.18.11.1`.

We introduced a Å„ew concept of price rules which required some changes to the
general invoicing algorithm. For example an invoice generator no longer needs
to give a single product that will be used for all invoices.

The notes plugin until now was always in the menu group office.
It can now be moved to another menu group. Tera moves t to courses.
A new user role `NotesStaff` because notes are confidential in Tera.
A secretary is office staff but must not see all notes.


I had a problem when building the docs (:ticket:`2731`):

>>> intersphinx_mapping = {}
>>> __file__ = "foo"
>>> from rstgen.sphinxconf import interproject
>>> interproject.configure(globals(), 'atelier lino_book')
>>> intersphinx_mapping
{u'atelierdocs': ('http://atelier.lino-framework.org', None), u'linobookdocs': ('http://www.lino-framework.org', None)}

Aha, the :envvar:`intersphinx_urls` was pointing to the www.LF but now it must point to docs.LF::

    intersphinx_urls = {
        'docs': "http://docs.lino-framework.org",
    }
