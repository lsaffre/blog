I continued to work on :ticket:`2368` (adapt the test suite) in order
to finish the eidreader project.

One change with rewriting eidreader from Java to the Python is that it
does not seem to have any middle_name field any more.  I can see only
two fields: `firstnames` and `first_letter_of_third_given_name` on the
cards we've read so far.


I worked on :ticket:`2363` (Bescheinigung ausserhalb
Beschlussperiode).  It is a duplicate of :ticket:`1354` (Deferred
RefundConfirmation : [u'Date range 19.04.16...19.04.16 lies outside of
granted period 01.01.15...01.04.16.']) which is waiting for their
feedback.  But when exploring it, I saw that the described less severe
checker rule for :class:`lino_welfare.modlib.aids.Confirmation` is not
yet active on their testlino.  The testlino still issues 686 data
problems when running :manage:`checkdata`.

Now I actually implemented the rule::

    if cp[1] is None: cp[1] = cp[0]

But this rule is obviously not enough because now they have 200
confirmations that don't obey the rule.  To prevent Lino from refusing
them in its database, I added a new plugin attribute
:attr:`no_date_range_veto_until
<lino_welfare.modlib.aids.Plugin.no_date_range_veto_until>`.

And finally.. after a long time I got all test suites to pass again.
At least on my machine and using Python 2.
