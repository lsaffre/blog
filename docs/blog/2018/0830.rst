I opened :ticket:`2516` because Vera will soon ask me how to print the
accounting data she's entering.  

First step is a new mixin :class:`lino.modlib.users.UserPlan`, i.e. I
extracted the logic from invoicing plan to make it useable for ledger
report.

I ran :cmd:`pp inv mm` after this.




Getting appy.pod run under Python 3
===================================

Here is how to install `appy-python-3`.  The fact that there is no
:xfile:`setup.py` file makes things more complicated.
       
To get the latest development version published on pallavi, you can
say ``pip install -r
"svn+https://svn.forge.pallavi.be/appy-dev/dev1#egg=appy"`` as we do
in the :file:`requirements.python3.txt` file of the book.

But if you develop yourself, i.e. want to use your local clone of that
repository, then you cannot use :cmd:`pip install` Here is how to
work around this.

First find our where is the :xfile:`site-packages` directory of your
environment::

  $ pywhich django
  /media/dell1tb/virtualenvs/py3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/__init__.py


Then add a symbolic link to that directory::

  $ cd /media/dell1tb/virtualenvs/py3/lib/python3.6/site-packages
  $ ln -s /home/luc/repositories/appy-python-3/trunk appy

The :cmd:`inv test` command failed in :ref:`xl`.  Since under Python
3, appy is installed using a symbolic link, :cmd:`setup.py test`
doesn't see it and tries to install it, which fails since appy itself
works only on Python 2.  So we must not add it to `install_requires`
in the :xfile:`setup_info.py`::

    import sys
    PY2 = sys.version_info[0] == 2
    if PY2:
        install_requires.append('appy')
    else:
        pass
    
I could then reproduce the place where Hamza is currently stuck::

  $ go book
  $ inv prep test

Yes, there are only 5 failures which look like trivial Python 2-to-3
issues.  I fixed one of them ("doctest docs/dev/builddocs.rst",
i.e. the source code of :ref:`lino.dev.bd`).
