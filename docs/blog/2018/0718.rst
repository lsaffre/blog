Lino Tera
=========

This morning I finally found the explanation for a phenomen (in
:ticket:`2364`) that I had been exploring yesterday the whole day: the
enrolments did not get imported any more.  The table in
:menuselection:`Explorer --> Courses --> Enrolments` showed only 4
rows when there should have been some 16000.  Here is what made me
understand:

>>> from lino.api.shell import *
>>> courses.Enrolment.objects.count()
18786

Yes, most enrolments now have state :attr:`requested`, and
:class:`AllEnrolments <lino_xl.lib.courses.AllEnrolments>` has a
default filter that hides them.  That was a mouse trap.  Be careful
when using a default filter in the tables of the Explorer menu.



New user role :class:`NotesUser`, and notes now require this role
instead of `(OfficeUser, OfficeOperator)`.  This requires the
:xfile:`user_types.py` in :ref:`tera` and :ref:`welfare` to be
adapted.

It seems that there is some design flaw in the
:meth:`lino.utils.config.ConfigDirCache.scan_config_dirs`: the local
config directory is not necessarily below the cache_dir
