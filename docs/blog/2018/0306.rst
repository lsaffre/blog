======================

After several days of fiddling (for :ticket:`2333`), I now start to be
satisfied (again) with the notification framework.

I started to convert documentation from docstrings in the code to
prosa specification in :ref:`book.specs.notify`.

I removed :class:`NotableAction` (a subclass of
:class:`lino.modlib.notify.NotifyingAction` which potentially also
creates a system note) because that was too much complication.  I
extended :class:`NotableAction` so that if the emitting object also
has a method :meth:`emit_system_note`, then this is being called as
well.  That's easier to understand.


I renamed ChangeObservable to ChangeNotifier

TODO: move notes from xl to lino core because otherwise it's difficult
to document. Or rather move notify from lino core to xl?



After about one week without Facebook, they now managed to send me an
SMS with the confirmation code.
