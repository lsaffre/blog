A new Lino hosting provider in Algeria
======================================

Abdelkader from Algeria wrote a little warehouse application for a
food reseller and installed it on a public demo site.  That was nice
work for a beginner!  That's the kind of situation where Lino is good.
He will get our free support for this project, and maybe at some
moment we agree that the project helps making Lino better and that we
also pay him money for his work.  I added him to our directory of
:ref:`hosting providers <hosters>`.


New documentation page about security
=====================================

As Abdelkader has experience with security, he ran penetration tests
and found some vulnerabilities.  This motivated me to start a new
documentation page :ref:`lino.admin.security`.
