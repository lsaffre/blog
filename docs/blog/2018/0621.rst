I think I found a good answer to
my questions
on :doc:`0619`
for :ticket:`2382` (Rendez-vous ext√©rieurs visibles pour l'accueil)

A new choicelist cal.PlannerColumns, a field EventType.planner_column,
and a new table `DayPlanner` which displays calendar entries using
these columns and one row per *time slot*.  Something like this:


===== ===============  ================      
Time  External         Internal
===== ===============  ================      
8:00  Jean, Luc
8:30  Mathieu
9:00                   Robin
9:30                   Jean
===== ===============  ================      


But how to configure the rows of that table? It should be configurable
per site (not e.g. per user) and via the web interface.

So we also need a new model PlannerRow.  A planner row contains the
threshold time and (potentially later) formatting instructions.

I don't think we want a new plugin ("planner") for this. I just add
them to the :mod:`lino_xl.lib.cal` plugin.
