======================

I understood what was happening yesterday: (1) some doctests
(:ref:`welfare.specs.cal` and welfare.specs.jobs) were modifying the
database (:attr:`SiteConfig.hide_events_before
<lino.modlib.system.SiteConfig.hide_events_before>`) and (2) the
doctests were being executed in arbitrary order.

I released :ref:`atelier` 1.1.6 for above change. See
:ref:`atelier.changes`.

And then the `{'system_note_type': [u"L'instance Event Type avec 1
dans id n'existe pas."]}` (:ticket:`2296`).  I am quite sure that it
has to do with our cahced SiteConfig.  I added some debug messages to
see what's happening.  The `first attempt
<https://travis-ci.org/lino-framework/welfare/jobs/373706473>`__
failed because --of course-- now most doctests are failing due to the
additional messages.  But the second attempt
<https://travis-ci.org/lino-framework/welfare/jobs/373761588>`__ was
intersting.
