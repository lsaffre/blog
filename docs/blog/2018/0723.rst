'datetime.time object' has no attribute 'date'
==============================================

How can :attr:`lino_xl.lib.cal.Guest.waiting_since` contain a
`datetime.time` value?


>>> from lino import startup
>>> startup('lino_welfare.projects.eupen.settings.doctests')
>>> from lino.api.doctest import *
>>> translation.activate('fr')

>>> from django.utils import timezone
>>> now = timezone.now()
>>> now.date()
datetime.date(2018, 7, 23)
>>> type(now)
<type 'datetime.datetime'>



The
:xfile:`presence_certificate.body.html` was using
:attr:`lino_xl.lib.excerpts.Excerpt.time` instead of
:attr:`lino_xl.lib.excerpts.Excerpt.date`.

It took me half an hour to verify that this issue was actually already
fixed in January 2018.  But they didn't yet upgrade since then, and I
didn't register the issue as a ticket. So now I opened :ticket:`2443`.



Using data from Wikidata
========================

Yesterday I did my first steps with pywikibot.

My first script:

.. literalinclude:: pwb/t1.py

My second script:

.. literalinclude:: pwb/t2.py

My first script with a concrete goal (it would be nice if my
`commondata` project would become useless):

..literalinclude:: pwb/list_countries_and_isocode.py

Next step on that script would be to also print the claims (as
explained in Data Harves tutorial).  I got stuck when I realized that
the ISO code fields seem to be empty when I run that query
on https://query.wikidata.org


EDIT: I later also forked the `wikidata
<https://github.com/lsaffre/wikidata>`__ project on GitHub and got the
following script to tun:

.. literalinclude:: pwb/t3.py
