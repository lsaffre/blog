Today and yesterday I finished working on :ticket:`2350` (Atelier avec
une s√©rie de 3 week-ends) by adding a test case in
:ref:`voga.specs.holidays` (which revealed some more minor problems,
one of them was that :class:`LongEntryChecker
<lino_xl.lib.cal.LongEntryChecker>` was silently setting the
`end_date` of these entries back to empty because the calendar entry
type had :attr:`max_days <lino_xl.lib.cal.EventType.max_days>` set
to 1.  I moved the logic to a :meth:`duration_veto` method and added a
:meth:`full_clean` method to :class:`cal.Event` so that it now
complains immediately when an entry lasts longer than the allowed
number of days. This will prevent users from accidentally setting
:attr:`end_date <lino_xl.lib.courses.Course.end_date>` instead of
:attr:`max_date <lino_xl.lib.courses.Course.max_date>`.
