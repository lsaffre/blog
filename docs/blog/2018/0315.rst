Gerd reported :ticket:`2343`. I upgraded their testlino site and fixed
the problem.

Updating their environment required of course a manual ``pip install
etgen``.  I also had :message:`ImportError: cannot import name
isidentifier` because that environment doesn't use a local repository
of atelier, so I quickly released atelier 1.0.14 on PyPI and did ``pip
install -U atelier``.

The actual problem was a missing translation in the
:xfile:`clothing_bank.body.html` template file.
