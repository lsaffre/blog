The :ref:`weleup` server sent me an error message "AttrDict instance
has no key 'immersion'".  Ticket :ticket:`2289`.  I added
``checksummaries`` to the demo_fixtures of
:mod:`lino_welfare.projects.eupen` so that this problem is covered by
the test suite.

I read Vitor Freitas' blog post `How to Implement Dependent/Chained
Dropdown List with Django
<https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2018/01/29/how-to-implement-dependent-or-chained-dropdown-list-with-django.html>`__
and --finally-- wrote a tutorial unit about choosers in Lino:
:ref:`lino.dev.combo`
