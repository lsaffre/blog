=========================

Some changes *en passant* during a release to a testlino:

- When :attr:`quick_search_fields
  <lino.core.model.Model.quick_search_fields>`
  :attr:`quick_search_fields_digit
  <lino.core.model.Model.quick_search_fields_digit>` contain names of
  non-existing fields, Lino now complains at startup. Until now we had
  an irritating traceback when the quick search was used.

- The :class:`lino.modlib.changes.Change` model now has
  :attr:`show_in_site_search
  <lino.core.model.Model.show_in_site_search>` set to `False`.

- :class:`lino_xl.lib.cal.ObsoleteEventTypeChecker` caused an
  AttributeError :message:`'NoneType' object has no attribute
  'update_cal_event_type'` when an entry had an `auto_type` but no
  `owner`.

  I noted that this checker currently does not yield the ("Event type
  but {0} (should be {1}).") problem as fixable.  Which AFAICS was a
  simple typo (actually we want it to set the event type), but I am
  not fully sure of this, so I leave the behaviour unchanged for now.

I updated our production server and played with :ticket:`2270`.
