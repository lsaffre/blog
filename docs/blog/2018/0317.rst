I tried to read the :ref:`lino.dev` with the eyes of a developer who
has some experience in Python and Django.

Already after the first paragraph of the first page
(:ref:`dev.install`) I found that there is missing something
important.  Normal people will ask here "Why can't I simply do
:cmd:`pip install lino`?".

I now added my answer to this question and opened :ticket:`2347`. I
also realized how important this ticket is. If we want to find
volunteer core developers for Lino, this is our next step to
do. Probably together with :ticket:`36`.
