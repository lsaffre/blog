I reviewed the :ref:`book.specs` section of the technical documentation and
converted some more plugins to prosa doc style.

Hamza and I started the release notes for :ref:`presto.18.12.0`. We changed the
Apache config on :ref:`lf` so that the content at
http://presto.lino-framework.org/ is now controlled by Hamza. Hamza has become
the second editor in the world of a public Lino doctree. Congratulations!
