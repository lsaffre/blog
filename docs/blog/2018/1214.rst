I reviewed the :ref:`book.specs` section of the technical documentation and
converted some more plugins to prosa doc style.

Hamza and I started the release notes for :ref:`presto.18.12.0`. We changed the
Apache config on :ref:`lf` so that the content at
http://presto.lino-framework.org/ is now controlled by Hamza. Hamza has become
the second editor in the world of a public Lino doctree. Congratulations!

I did a few small optimizations for :ref:`noi` : :ticket:`2752` (My tickets to
work sorting order). Of course these require a new release for :ref:`xl`. OMG.
Okay, I admit that we must switch back :ref:`book` to use the development
version of :mod:`lino_xl` because we do not yet want to write release notes for
things like that at the moment.
