=======================

Vera complained that while MakeCopy has a bug: after selecting the
partner, you don't know whether that partner has a `purchase_account`.
You see this only after confirming the dialog.  And if it had no
purchase account, Lino even copies the account of the last invoice.  I
opened :ticket:`2483`.

Our first idea was to have the account field in the dialog window get
modified when the user selects a partner.  But there is currently no
way to do it.  This would have to be a kind of active field for action
dialog forms.

But then I had a better idea: make the `make_copy` action useless.

I added a new boolean field `items_edited` on the invoice, which
defaults to False and is set to True as soon as user edited some item.
When it is False, changes in the upper part of the voucher (totals,
partner, vat_regime, ...) cause the item to be changed automatically.
Needed some meditation and understanding the
:mod:`lino_xl.lib.vat.mixins` module. My first manual tests look
promising.  I expect regressions and other surprises, but I fully
trust that Vera will find them.
