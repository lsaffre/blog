There was still a failure on :ref:`travis` for :mod:`lino_extjs6`
(which is sleeping at the moment but still was a nasty red patch among
all that green). I then saw that `WeasyPrint 0.43
<https://weasyprint.org/news/>`__ has been released and doesn't
support Python 2 anymore. Which caused me to tidy up the requirements
in :ref:`lino`, :ref:`xl` and `man`.
