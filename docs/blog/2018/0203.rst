==========================

I realized that :ticket:`2295` is still there and that my yesterday's
changes didn't fix the problem at all.  Now I did another series of
subtle changes in :mod:`rstgen.sphinxconf.interproject` and even
:mod:`atelier.projects`.  The idea is that the :file:`objects.inv`
needed for intersphinx links can be either on the local file system or
via internet using :envvar:`intersphinx_urls`.  If I have installed a
Lino SDK, then I don't need no internet connection to build all docs.
On Travis where we have no full SDK installed so there we need an
Internet connection.


L'instance Event Type avec 1 dans id n'existe pas
=================================================

We have a failure on Tavis in :ref:`welfare` under Python 2 : `Job
398.1
<https://travis-ci.org/lino-framework/welfare/jobs/336826267>`_. It
says :message:`{'system_note_type': [u"L'instance Event Type avec 1
dans id n'existe pas."]}`.

The same test passes on my machine::

    $ go eupen
    $ dm test tests.test_broken_gfks

Maybe the :attr:`lino.core.site.Site.site_config` is not cleared
correctly between two tests?  I added a print `print("20180203 Gonna
clear_site_config")` to the :data:`testcase_setup` handler in
:mod:`lino.modlib.system`. This does not seem to be the reason. Hm...
