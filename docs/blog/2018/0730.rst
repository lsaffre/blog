=====================

I reviewed the :ref:`dev.overview` page of the Developer's Guide.

I had a HO session with Hamza.  We did some triaging.  It was
disturbing that we cannot change the state of a ticket from new to
closed directly.

I found the explanation for :ticket:`2462` (L'accueil n'arrive plus à
encoder de nouveaux bénéficiaires).  It was a side effect of
:ticket:`2436` 

Two weeks ago while working on :ticket:`2436` (editable remote fields
/ SalesRule.invoice_recipient).  I changed the definition of
OneToOneStoreField because I thought that this was needed for #2436.
This change was actually not needed.  And it turned out to be
disturbing only now.  Because it changed the behaviour of
OneToOneField.  I only now realized that in `reception.Clients` the
`person_ptr` field is being used as primary key.

See "When the primary key is a OneToOneField" section in
:ref:`welfare.specs.reception`.

I also added a case in :ref:`tera.specs.misc` to verify that the
editable remote field still works after undoing above change.
