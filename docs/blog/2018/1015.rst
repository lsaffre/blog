Working on :ref:`tera`.  There were some ledger.Movement without valid
voucher in their database.  These were created by incomplete `tl3.py`
imports.

Also I saw that the :attr:`lino_xl.lib.accounting.Journal.dc` of their
journals still needed to be inverted.  (EDIT: later 20181016 this
turned out as wrong.  The dc were good, but Lino had a bug: an income
in a bank statement line debits the named account (and an expense
credits it).

Maybe I could simply write an admin command which rebuilds all
movements?  Ha! It exists already: :manage:`reregister`.  But I had to
add a feature: when no arguments are specified (which means
re-register them all), then :manage:`reregister` now starts by
deleting all :class:`lino_xl.lib.accounting.Movement` objects.  That's
more time-efficient and --the key point here-- also removes moevements

Illiterate developers
=====================

When talking with deciders about Lino, I sometimes perceive a problem
of language difference.  Tonight Thomas helped me to understand the
(probable) reason: I don't use pictures.  When things become more
complex, you simply don't get an overview without a diagram.  Yes,
it's one of my handicaps: among project managers I am a kind of
illiterate as long as I don't master the art of drawing diagrams.
