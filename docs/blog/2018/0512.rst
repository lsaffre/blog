Hoppel has a problem::

    /dev/sda1 contains a file system with errors, check forced.
    Inodes that were part of a corrupted orphan linked list found.
    /dev/sda1: UNEXPETED INCONSISTENCY; RUN fsck MANUALLY (i.e. without -a or -p options)
    fsck exited with status code 4
    The root filesystem on /dev/sda1 requires a manual fsck
    BusyBox
    (initramfs)


Thanks to `askubuntu.com
<https://askubuntu.com/questions/697190/fsck-error-on-boot-dev-sda6-unexpected-inconsistency-run-fsck-manually>`__
and here we go.  I typed :cmd:`fsck /dev/sda1` and here we go::

    e2fsck 1.43.5 (04-Aug-2017)

    Inode 34124665 was part of the orphaned inode list. FIXED.
    Inode 35001113 extent tree (at level 1) could be shorter. Fix<y>? yes
    (...)
    Block bitmap differences: (...)


I also had `this problem <https://askubuntu.com/questions/760825/cannot-boot-system-due-to-start-job-running-for-hold?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=google_rich_qa&utm_campaign=google_rich_qa>`__   

Afterwards I could start into recovery (hold INS key at startup?)
mode and run a root shell.
