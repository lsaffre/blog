I continued working for :ref:`tera` on ticket :ticket:`2651` (which is
related to :ticket:`2658`).  I realized that neither presences nor
calendar entries (:class:`cal.Guest` or :class:`cal.Event`) are
:class:`lino_xl.lib.invoicing.Invoiceable`, but enrolment
(:class:`lino_tera.lib.courses.Enrolment`).  Because not every
presence is invoiceable, and only the enrolment (and its dossier) can
decide this.  There are dossiers for whom they invoice a maximum
number of presences per month, if they come more often then it's
free. For family therapies they don't invoice per presence but per
calendar entry.
