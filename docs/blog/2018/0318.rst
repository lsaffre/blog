I continued to work on :ticket:`36`, concretely getting the
:ref:`welfare` test sute to pass.

     
- Some snippets in :ref:`avanti.specs.courses` were failing because of
  differing output in Python 2*3. Had to find the trick.
       
- :class:`lino_xl.lib.appypod.AppyBuildMethod` no longer logs the
  current language and the options when rendering a template.  Because
  the options is a dict which causes varying messages under Python 3,
  and because also the language is after al just interesting when
  debugging.
