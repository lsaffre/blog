========================

For the first time after three years I had to compile a new TIM exe
file for a customer.  This made me realize that changes during the
last years had never been pushed to the `GitHub repository
<https://github.com/lsaffre/tim>`__.  Now I added tim to my atelier so
that I won't forget it anymore.  Today's actual code change is
described in a file `docs/blog/2018/0109.rst
<https://github.com/lsaffre/tim/blob/59fd32cb2dd926ca8f96210efc251bc958009024/docs/blog/2018/0109.rst>`__
of the TIM repo. Currently these docs aren't being rendered as html
anywhere to the Internet.
