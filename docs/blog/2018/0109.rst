I realized that changes in TIM during the last years had never been
pushed to the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/lsaffre/tim>`__.
Now I added tim to my atelier so that I won't forget it anymore.
Today's actual code change is described in a file
`docs/blog/2018/0109.rst
<https://github.com/lsaffre/tim/blob/59fd32cb2dd926ca8f96210efc251bc958009024/docs/blog/2018/0109.rst>`__
in the TIM repo. Currently these docs aren't being rendered as html
anywhere to the Internet.

Denis from Canada signaled his potential interest for helping us to
make the Lino Book better.  With him in mind I reviewed and updated
the :ref:`lino.dev.bd` page.
