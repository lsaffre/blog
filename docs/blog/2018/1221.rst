=========================

I fixed some problems in cpaschatelet after the last release.

I restored the detail layouts for the contracts in isip and immersion (because
at least the field eval_policy is actually also still used).

I fixed a bug which caused a traceback "RelatedObjectDoesNotExist: Course has
no line." and potentially a problem Cannot create course in "My courses"
reported by aurelie.  Added a test case in :ref:`welfare.specs.courses2`.

There was a mysterious problem when they tried to print a :class:`notes.Note`::

    Traceback (most recent call last):

    AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'items'

When trying to explore the problem, I noted that ``lino_xl`` was missing in
their :attr:`lino.core.site.Site.auto_configure_logger_names` and added it, and
afterwards the problem had vanished without any valid explanation.

I stumbled into the pitfall that `beid.Plugin.url_handler_prefix` must include
the "://" and added a new error message "Invalid urlhandler_prefix {} (must end
with '://')"
