========================

I undid a change in :mod:`lino_xl.lib.clients` on Friday where I added
a `default=''` to the `client_state` parameter field::

  client_state=ClientStates.field(blank=True, default='')) 

Because we want to have the choicelists's default_value there, not a
blank value. In :ref:`avanti` it's important to hide non-active
clients also from the list of choices of foreign keys to client.

I updated the ClientStates in :ref:`tera`.

I adapted some tests after yesterday's changes.

I read `a question on SO
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48383199/splitting-names-that-include-de-da-etc-into-first-middle-last-etc>`__
with Brazilian names, added them as examples to
:ref:`lino.tutorial.human`, added some name prefixes and fixed a bug
in :mod:`lino.mixins.human` module.  But for the name "Francisco da
Sousa Rodrigues" Lino currently still fails because it ignores that
there are people with a double family names. Okay if there is a name
prefix (like "da" in our example) Lino should recognize that here it
is one given name and three family names.  But I guess there are many
people with a double family name and without such a prefix.  In these
cases I don't see any real solution.
