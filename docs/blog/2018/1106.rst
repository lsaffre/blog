Next meeting for Lino Tera
=============================

I had a meeting with Harry and Olivier where we evaluated
:ref:`tera.18.11.0` and started 
:ref:`tera.18.11.1`.

  
Insert button more visible
==========================

When rendering a slave table panel of a table with an insert_layout,
Lino automatically adds an insert button. That button was often
difficult to discover for non-initiated users, e.g. in the
:class:`lino_xl.lib.courses.EnrolmentsByCourse` panel.  because it was
in the bottom toolbar of its panel.

They asked me to have it immediately below the data.  And they wanted
the insert button to also appear in the dashboard.  So I had the
following idea.

.. currentmodule:: lino.core.actions
                 
I added a new action attribute :attr:`Action.show_in_plain`.  The
default value is `False`, but :class:`ShowInsert` overrides this and
has `True`.
