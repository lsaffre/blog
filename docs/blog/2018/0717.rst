I updated the README file for the now obsolete Java implementation of
eidreader: https://github.com/lsaffre/eidreader That project will
continue to hang around.  There is even somebody who would pay for
re-porting the Python implementation back to a Java application.  This
might be possible, but I am not a candidate because I am not a Java
fan and I have enough other projects.  Contact me if you are
interested in that job.
