And here we go for our next version of Lino! The new
:class:`lino.modlib.summaries.Summarized` mixin didn't yet update its fields
during :manage:`checkdata`.

I released :ref:`lino.18.12.2` on PyPI which also causes

I fixed a bug in


- :func:`lino.utils.jsgen.py2js` now has a keyword argument "compact" that
  defaults to True. Because the default behaviour of py2js returns a massive
  1-line response which makes it almost impossible to find where an issue in the
  json is if there is some problem. In the react renderer im having it using the
  :attr:`lino.core.site.Site.is_demo_site` value to determine if it wants to
  have it be compact or not.



Bugfix release for .
