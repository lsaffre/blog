Better summary for EntriesByCourse
==================================

I continued to work on :ticket:`2441`.  I call it now "intelligent"
because it dynamically chooses between table and bullet-list mode
depending on the number of appointments.

I started to tidy up in
:mod:`lino.utils.format_date`
and :mod:`lino_xl.lib.cal.utils`.


I introduced the new calendar entry state "missed".  In :ref:`tera`
this is important because a missed appointment may get invoiced while
a cancelled appointment not.  I added this to :ref:`specs.tera.cal`.


En passant I fixed two failures in :ref:`book` caused by Hamza's
recent changes (new :class:`DeviceTypeMiddleware
<lino.core.auth.middleware.DeviceTypeMiddleware>`).
