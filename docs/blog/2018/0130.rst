I added a new new option `--max-row-count` to the :manage:`dump2py`
command.  The default value is 50000, which means that when a table
has more than 50000 rows


This fixes :ticket:`2286` (Python process being killed) for
good, or at least I hope so.  The explanation and workaround which I
found :doc:`three days ago <0127>` was not enough for the :ref:`spz`
production site where they currently have 136000 calendar entries.
Trying to load them using a single file would kill any Python process
that tries to load the source file into memory. Without that fix I
would have to do the manual split for each data migration.
