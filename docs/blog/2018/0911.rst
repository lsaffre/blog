- my fork of sphinxfeed now has "from setuptools import setup" instead
  of "from distutils.core import setup" because complained about
  Unknown distribution option 'install_requires' and
  'include_package_data'.

- I reviewed docs for :ref:`specs.weasyprint` and
  :ref:`xl.specs.excerpts` and converted them from autodoc to prosa
  style.

- I updated :ref:`book.changes`.  

And now I finally seem to have done what I wanted on :doc:`0906`.


`This build failure
<https://travis-ci.org/lino-framework/book/jobs/427078241>`__
surprised me.  We have specified `sqlparse` in `tests_require` but not
in `install_requires`.  I know it would pass if we put it to
`install_requires`, but that would be "wrong".  Why does it fail?  It
seems that `setup.py test` does not always install the packages
`tests_require`.

I removed also mock from the requirements file and have them now both
in the install_requires.
