Yesterday I worked 7 hours to find out that I had
:attr:`urlhandler_prefix <lino_xl.lib.beid.Plugin.urlhandler_prefix>`
set to ``'beid'``.  But it must be ``'beid://'``.  So the popup window
opened by :xfile:`beid/eidreader.js` called for an URL of type
``beidhttp://example.com/eid/uuid`` instead of
``beid://http://example.com/eid/uuid``.  And browsers are very good at
discretely ignoring popups that try to open some unknown URL protocol.
