======================

I poked around in Jane, trying to organize our sites and meditating
about :ticket:`2430`.  I was unable to delete an unused site because
it had summary records.  The :class:`lino.modlib.summaries.Summary`
mixin now also sets :attr:`allow_cascaded_delete
<lino.core.model.Model.allow_cascaded_delete>` to ``['master']``.  *En
passant* I converted more docstrings to prosa in
:ref:`noi.specs.tickets`.

I fixed a problem which caused the lightbox to not work on my `German
blog <http://luc.saffre-rumma.net/blog/2018/0706.html>`__.  The actual
problem was in the :xfile:`layout.html` template, but *en passant* I
updated the docstring of :mod:`atelier.sphinxconf.sigal_image`.
