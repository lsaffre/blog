How to automatically display the reference of a
:class:`StructuredReferrable <lino.mixins.refs.StructuredReferrable>`
in most places, without forcing existing applications to change from
:class:`BabelNamed` to :class:`BabelDesignated`?  New method
:meth:`get_designation
<lino.mixins.refs.StructuredReferrable.get_designation>`.

Should the menu item label for
:attr:`lino_xl.lib.invoicing.Plan.start_plan` be rather "Create
invoices" (as it has been so far) or may it become "Invoicing plan"
(as would be easier to implement now that the action is automatically
defined on :class:`lino.modlib.users.UserPlan`)?  Answer: It *should*
be customizable, and :class:`lino_xl.lib.invoicing.StartInvoicing`
shows that it actually *is*.
