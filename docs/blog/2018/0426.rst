========================

I did an upgrade on Jane because I needed the results of the new
:class:`SitesByReport <lino_xl.lib.working.SitesByReport>` table.  (I
found out that the `eidreader` site caused 44 hours of work since
January, a number I need for writing invoices.  Three production sites
are using this functionality.)  The TicketsByReport table no longer
shows the project ("Mission") but the site.

The :ref:`cpaschatelet` users asked that user type 120 (and 420) should have
permission to edit coachings whose author is another user.

:class:`lino_xl.lib.coachings.Coaching` has its
:attr:`manager_roles_required
<lino.modlib.users.mixins.Authored.manager_roles_required>` set to
`{CoachingsStaff}`.

Code change:

- In :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.welfare.user_types`,
  IntegrationAgentFlexible now inherits from IntegrationStaff (not
  just from IntegrationAgent).

It was quite some work to adapt the test suites.
