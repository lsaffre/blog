Gerd reported :ticket:`2342` (ChangePassword action button has no
help_text) and indeed: :func:`lino.core.utils.simplify_name` didn't
simplify ``actions`` and ``mixins``.

This change required me to run :cmd:`inv clean` followed by :cmd:`inv
bd` in all projects so that my :xfile:`help_texts.py` files get
rewritten.  Because for example the help text of
:attr:`lino_xl.lib.beid.mixins.BeIdCardHolder.nationality` is now
stored under it new simplified name
``lino_xl.lib.beid.BeIdCardHolder.nationality``.

And I also fixed an old ergonomy problem: the buttons in the [My
settings] window were at the bottom instead of (as usual) at the top
of the form. It was easier than I thought: we just must set
`hide_navigator` on the default action instead of setting
`hide_top_toolbar` on the actor. (TODO: document, optimize the
names...)
