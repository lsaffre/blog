Lino Tera advancing
===================

Today I have been working on :ticket:`2364`.

I finished to adapt the test suites and committed my yesterday's
changes.

I then moved :class:`SalesRule` from :mod:`lino_xl.lib.sales` to
:mod:`lino_xl.lib.invoicing`.  The former is being used e.g. in
:ref:`cosi` where you create sales invoices but don't create them
automatically.  In that case you don't need an invoicing recipient.

I ran :xfile:`tl2.py` many times on their production site, each time
with some code changes pushed via github in projects :ref:`xl` and
:ref:`tera`.  That's the easiest way because the script runs for quite
long, and their server is more powerful than my computer.


About quantities
================

For Abdelkader I started a new page in the Developers Guide:
:ref:`book.dev.quantities`.  Some minor changes in the internal API of
the :class:`lino_xl.lib.sales.InvoiceItem` model in order to simplify
the examples.
     
I noticed that the examples in the docstrings of 
:mod:`lino.utils.quantities` were not being tested.
