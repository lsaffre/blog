Making screenshots with Selenium
================================

Our first :ref:`Screenshot tour <dev.tours>` is currently broken. It
says::

  InvalidArgumentException: Message: Expected [object Undefined] undefined to be a string
     
Upgraded Selenium from 3.8.0 to 3.8.1. No change.  Tried with Python 3
instead of 2. No change (except for the details of the traceback)::

    $ python docs/tours/team/maketour.py 
    Wrote screenshot docs/tours/team/login1.png ...

The details of the traceback differ because there were two places like
this where I forwarded the exception `e` to the :func:`print_exc`
and/or :func:`format_exc` functions::

    try:
        ...
    except Exception as e:
        self.error_message = traceback.format_exc(e)
        traceback.print_exc(e)

This was simply wrong, but under Python 2 it didn't cause an
additional exception.  The first argument for these functions is
`limit`, you cannot specify some arbitrary exception to them, they
always use exception that happened as the system's last one. The code
must be::

    try:
        ...
    except Exception:
        self.error_message = traceback.format_exc()
        traceback.print_exc()


Django Channels version 2
=========================

The `Django Channels <https://channels.readthedocs.io/>`__ project has
passed to version 2, and that version no longer supports Python 2.
This caused a minor dependency problem for us:

On :ref:`jane` we use :mod:`lino.modlib.notify` (which requires
channels).  And Jane is still under Python 2.  Also the main Lino test
suite in :ref:`book` depends on Django Channels.  And we (currently
still) want it to pass under Python 2.

So I changed dependency specs from 'channels' to 'channels<2' in several projects:

The `lino-framework.org` server is down
=======================================

The `lino-framework.org` server is currently down.  This also is the
reason for failures on Travis, e.g.  `this one
<https://travis-ci.org/lino-framework/voga/jobs/336522007>`__
