I started to explore the OpenUI5 JavaScript library.  Looks promising.

How to allow file access from `file:` protocol::

   $ chromium-browser --allow-file-access-from-files index.html

(Thanks to `this <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10752055/cross-origin-requests-are-only-supported-for-http-error-when-loading-a-local>`__)

Aur√©lie introduced ticket :ticket:`2251` which shows that the
:class:`end_date <lino_xl.lib.courses.Course.end_date>` field of an
activity continues to cause confusion.  Users tend to mix it up with
the :class:`max_date <lino_xl.lib.courses.Course.max_date>` field.  I
now changed the layout so that the `end_date` is after the times, and I
added help texts and translated them to French.

Later I also converted the docstrings :mod:`lino_xl.lib.courses` to a
prose document (the :ref:`specs.courses` specs).

A change in :ref:`tim` : :file:`DLM/latex/VENSTD3.TEX` : increased
column width for price from 16 to 17 mm because ``-2.800,00`` didn't
fit.
