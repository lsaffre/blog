I started working for :ticket:`2767`. Details in the release notes for
:ref:`tera.18.12.0`.

I ran :mod:`spzloader2` another time.
This script still gives a few warnings
Warning: Cannot delete Dossier XXX (ET S110079) because 2 Interests refer to it.
The solution was to set in :class:`topics.Interest`` ::

    allow_cascaded_delete = ["partner"]


IOW the interests of a partner should not prevent a user from deleting the
partner.  If the user decides to delete a partner and some existing
:class:`lino_xl.lib.topics.Interest` refers to the partner, it should be
deleted automatically.
