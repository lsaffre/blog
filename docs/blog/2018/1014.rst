========================

I undid the following change in
:class:`lino.core.elems.CharFieldElement` (which I committed
20180828)::

    -        self.preferred_width = 1 + min(20, max(3, self.field.max_length or 0))
    +        if self.preferred_width is None:  # 20180828
    +            self.preferred_width = 1 + min(
    +                20, max(3, self.field.max_length or 0))


Because that change now turned out to be the cause for :ticket:`2583`
(Wrong column widths in MySessionsByDate).  I vaguely remember that
the change was an attempt to fix the column widths in the accounting
report before I changed from appypdf to weasyprint.
