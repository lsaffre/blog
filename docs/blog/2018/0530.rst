During the last days I continued to work on :ticket:`2391`. Gerd
convinced me that the most realistic method is to set up myself a
Windows machine with the development environment and cx_freeze.


TIL: The :xfile:`setup_info.py` needs to be loaded using ``exec`` only
from the :xfile:`setup.py` file.  The main package's
:file:`__init__.py` file must not do this because the file won't be
there when the script has been built with cx_freeze.  Instead of
saying::

  from eidreader import SETUP_INFO

we can say::
  
  from eidreader.setup_info import SETUP_INFO
