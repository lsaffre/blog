Abdelkader did penetration tests on a Lino site and reported that it
is not protected against clickjacking.  Indeed, Lino doesn't provide
this as a default.  But Django provides a simple solution (at least
for modern browsers): `Clickjacking Protection
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/clickjacking/>`__

So in order to to protect a Lino application against clickjacking, you
add one line to your :xfile:`settings.py`::

    class Site(Site):
        ...

    SITE = Site(globals())

    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES += (
        'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware',)
