For the OpenUI5 project we started to meditate about the dashboard,
quick links and layouts in general.

- there should be more types of dashboard items: 
  for quick links, for welcome messages, for menus.
- Tables in the dashboard might be rendered using the default ui
  renderer instead of plain html.
- The whole :xfile:`admin_main_base.html` template would be just a
  list of dashboard items.
- It might be useful to use a layout for defining the dashboard.
- Layouts are currently meant to work on a screen with fixed height,
  but I think we could easily adapt them to work for the dashboard as
  well, i.e. a "form" with endless height and scroll bars.
- The whole concept having everything in a "window" might disapeear
  with OpenUI5.
- the current main menu might hide away into a hamburger button.
