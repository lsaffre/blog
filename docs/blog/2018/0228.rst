I finally managed to reproduce failure in `Job #659.1
<https://travis-ci.org/lino-framework/book/jobs/345142174>`__ on my
machine.  It comes with Sphinx 1.7.1 and not with Sphinx 1.7.0.

I posted `Sphinx issue 4689
<https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/4689>`__.  This issue
causes not only summary tables with oddly truncated summaries, it
causes syntax warnings depending on where the cut is being done.

And as a workaround until somebody fixes the Sphinx issue, I updated
the :term:`install_requires` of :ref:`atelier` so that it installs only
version 1.7.0.
