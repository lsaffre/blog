========================

Two changes for :ref:`avanti` and a release to their production
server.  I updated the :ref:`specs.avanti`, and renamed the release
notes to :ref:`avanti.changes.2018.10`.

I released :ref:`noi.v18.10` to Jane.

Official PyPI release October 2018?
===================================

I incremented the version numbers for avanti, noi and welfare because
for these we even have release notes.  

Some days ago I started working for :ticket:`2599` in atelier.  Now I
published my changes.  The :cmd:`inv release` command now simply
creates a *branch* instead of a *tag*.
