I continued to play after the upgrade on the :ref:`tera` production
site on our way to :ref:`tera.18.11.1` : manual tests in their data,
optimizations and minor bugs, write docs,...

One bug was cool: Dangling vouchers without MTI leaf.  Vera reported
this problem (:ticket:`2683`).  I then saw that it is caused by
:mod:`lino_xl.lib.tim2lino.spzloader3` which uses Django's
:meth:`_raw_delete` method to delete invoices and their content, but
forgets to delete also the movements and the bare voucher entries.  I
extended the ledger.VoucherChecker to detect and delete dangling
vouchers and their movements.
