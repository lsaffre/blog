Today I experimented with :attr:`webdav_protocol
<lino.core.site.Site.webdav_protocol>` and getting Lino to invoke the
client's Office program on editable printable documents.  A new
feature is that on a development server it automatically uses a
``file://`` link, which makes testing easier.

A difficulty seems to be how to configure Chrome

When is
non-empty, Lino expects the browser to be configured to understand
that protocol and ignores whether :mod:`lino.modlib.davlink` is
installed or not.
