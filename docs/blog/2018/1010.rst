I started working on :ticket:`2579`, a compound ticket entitled
"Hausaufgaben nach Treffen 20181009".

Jane for customers
==================

I did some optimizations in Jane because their new CEO asked for an
overview of what needs to be done. The best answer is to let him
use Jane.  It is the first time Jane will be entered by this type of
user.  Before showing him, I review it, did some optimizations and
updated Jane.  For example, simple Jane user should see only their
sites (to which they are subscribed).

During :xfile:`restore.py` I had a traceback :message:`'NoneType'
object has no attribute 'model'`.  Caused a by a bug in
:mod:`lino.utils.dpy` which probably had been introduced by Django 2
support.  Fixed.
