I started working on :ticket:`2579`, a compound ticket entitled
"Hausaufgaben nach Treffen 20181009".

Jane for customers
==================

I did some optimizations in Jane because a customer asked for an
overview of what needs to be done. The best answer is to let him use
Jane.  It is the first time Jane will be entered by this type of user.
Before showing him, I review it, did some optimizations and updated
Jane.  For example, simple Jane user should see only their sites (to
which they are subscribed).

During :xfile:`restore.py` I had a traceback :message:`'NoneType'
object has no attribute 'model'`.  Caused a by a bug in
:mod:`lino.utils.dpy` which probably had been introduced by Django 2
support.  Fixed.

eidreader version 1.0.6
=======================

eidreader still had a stupid bug which made it crash when a config
file was found.  After fixing that bug we realized that no config file
is necessary if the proxy settings are done a system level so
getproxies returns them.
