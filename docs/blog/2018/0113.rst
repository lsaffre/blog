I started to change the year of copyright statements from 2017 to 2018
in the Sphinx :xfile:`conf.py` files and the :xfile:`COPYING` or
:xfile:`LICENSE` files of most projects.

Usually it is something like this::

  copyright = '2015-2018 Luc Saffre'

In one project (:ref:`extjs6`) we have::

  copyright = '2015-2018 Luc Saffre & Hamza Khchine'

Which is probably not what we want in the long run.  At least Tonis is
missing there.  And actually we do not want to add every individual
contributor to every copyright statement.  The best option would
probably be something like this::

  copyright = '2015-2018 Lino Team'

But we currently don't have any legal person called "Lino Team".  We
have either "Luc Saffre" or "Rumma & Ko OÃœ".  And if some day we would
found a legal entity for Lino, then its name would probably not be
"Lino Team" because it is too general as a name. There are other
projects called "Lino".  See :ref:`lino.name`.  Possible other names
for that future entity are "Lino Framework project" or "Lino Software
Foundation".

I started to change the documentation under :ref:`lino.team` and
:ref:`lino.copyright`.
