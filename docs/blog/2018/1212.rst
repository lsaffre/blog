============================

I started a 3-in-1 release : Lino :ref:`lino.18.12.0`, Lino XL 18.12.1 and Noi
:ref:`noi.v18.11.1`. I checked in and migrated Jane to the new version (which
caused some more quick commits). It is almost done but before publishing it on
PyPI I should run the test suite and adapt doctests on my machine.  Travis will
fail of course until Lino and XL are released on PyPI.

I finally found a satisfying solution for :ticket:`2746`.
Took more time than expected.
