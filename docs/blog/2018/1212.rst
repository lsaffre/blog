============================

Today I did a 3-in-1 release : Lino :ref:`lino.18.12.1`, Lino XL 18.12.1 and
Noi :ref:`noi.v18.11.1`. I checked in and migrated Jane to the new version
(which caused some more quick commits). It took some time because before
publishing it on PyPI I had to run the test suite and adapt doctests on my
machine. En passant I finally found a satisfying solution for :ticket:`2746`.
Took more time than expected. Travis was failing of course as long as Lino and
XL were not released on PyPI.
