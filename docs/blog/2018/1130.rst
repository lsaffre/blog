I released :ref:`tera.18.11.1`.  This was a long and intensive working session.
It was the first time that I finished a release with a user manual and without
the assistance of the customer's coordinator.  I had to do all the manual tests
on my own.

Hamza and I had a long and exciting hangout where we created together a
prototype for :ref:`presto`.  It is almost done ('Plan' object has no attribute
'course'). I am optimistic that Hamza and Thierry will be able to continue this
project without me.  This is a historic day for Lino!
