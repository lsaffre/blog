I started to answer one of Abdelkader's problems by adding a
"Troubleshooting" section in the :ref:`lino.dev.bd` page.

Nothing against 1:1 sessions on Hangouts, but our goal is more than
just to get it running on Abdelkader's machine: We also want to
understand what's missing in the docs, so that future readers have
less troubles.
