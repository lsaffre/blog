How to populate the main window with content
============================================

Abdelkader had asked for more information about how to populate the
main window with content.  To answer his questions, I gave hime a
crash course on Hangout yesterday.

Indeed this topic is one of the holes in the documentation.  Today I
started to fill the hole: a new introducing tutorial page
:ref:`dev.admin_main` and a specs page :ref:`specs.dashboard`.

During this I stumbled into `Sphinx issue 5007
<https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/5007>`__, and I took the
time to report it.

     


I fixed a regression that nobody had reported yet: when trying to
merge two tickets, Lino said :message:`TypeError: bad argument type:
__proxy__(u'will get reassigned.')`.
