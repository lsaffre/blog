Today I worked the whole day on how to print the annual report.
Results see :doc:`0907`.

Here is a code snippet I used for testing today:

>>> from etgen.html import E, tostring
>>> e = E.th("Foo")
>>> e.set('align', 'right')
>>> print(tostring(e))
<th align="right">Foo</th>
>>> e.set('class', 'number')
>>> print(tostring(e))
<th align="right" class="number">Foo</th>



I don't yet push these changes because there is more to do:

- add header to the document
- add preview to DetailLayout and turn entries tables into
  SlaveTableActions
- Rename "Report Entries" to "Balances"?
- adapt test suites and docs
- remove the old report
