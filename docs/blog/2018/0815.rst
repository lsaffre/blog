==========================

I just wanted to quickly document what I have been doing for
:ticket:`2487` and got lost into unpaid work: I reviewed a few
chapters in the Lino book about :ref:`specs.accounting` and
:ref:`help_texts`.

I renamed the "partner account" of a trade type to the "main account".
En passant I restructured the accounting stuff in the Lino Book.

:class:`lino_xl.lib.vat.VatDocument`

I noted that months before September should be numbered 1 to 9 and not
01 to 09 because otherwise setuptools will normalize them and issue a
UserWarning::

   /site-packages/setuptools/dist.py:397: UserWarning: Normalizing '18.04.0' to '18.4.0'


I started to dive into OpenUI by writing documentation:
:ref:`specs.openui5`.  Still only at the beginning.

I did some tidy-up, e.g. I removed
:class:`lino.modlib.openui5.views.Index` since it is used only by the
:mod:`lino_xl.lib.pages` plugin.
