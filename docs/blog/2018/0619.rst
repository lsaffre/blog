I released :ref:`welfare` version `2018-06-19
<http://fr.welfare.lino-framework.org/changes/20180619.html>`__ in
Chatelet: they now finally read id cards without Java.  The release
had had to wait because I first had to write a windows installer for
eidreader (:ticket:`2391`).


I interviewed Mathieu about :ticket:`2392`.  They want reception
clerks to know when an agent has an external appointment.

I am still not sure how to configure whether an appointment should be
considered "external" or not.

First idea was a new field `EventType.is_external` and a table
`ExternalAppointmentsToday`.
But that would add yet another checkbox.
Per entry or per entry type.
What about agents being in holidays?
Maybe start using the `access_class` field.
And maybe we should name it
something more general than "external".
Or maybe they actually need a "list of unavailable users"?
To be meditated.
