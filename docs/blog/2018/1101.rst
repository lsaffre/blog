I committed and pushed my yesterday's changes (mostly for
:ticket:`2622`)

I had a merge conflict with Hamza::        

    From git+ssh://github.com/lino-framework/welfare
       601e2ffd..cfcc8095  master     -> origin/master
    CONFLICT (modify/delete): docs/specs/uploads.rst deleted in HEAD and modified in cfcc80957e4aff262299f38fc9ae347dd0f09d39. Version cfcc80957e4aff262299f38fc9ae347dd0f09d39 of docs/specs/uploads.rst left in tree.
    Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

I also moved the French and German docs about Welfare to the book.
Because they need the demo projects, and because we don't need them in the code repository on a welfare production site.
