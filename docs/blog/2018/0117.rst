===========================

I stumbled once more into :ticket:`2263`, a subtle problem in
:mod:`lino.modlib.memo.parser` that survived several bug huntings in the past.
But today I finally fixed it.

I had a few attacks of inspiration for optimizing the developers
guide...  OMG, we have two customers waiting for me to work on paying
issues, and still I can't stop fiddling in the docs... which shows
that Sphinx is inded a tool which makes programmers *want* to write
documentation.


Avanti continued
================

I added a new choicelist
:class:`lino_xl.lib.clients.CommonContactTypes`
