I fixed some :ref:`welfare` test suite failures caused by
:ticket:`2433`.


Responsive-friendly TicketDetail layout
=======================================

The :class:`lino_noi.lib.tickets.TicketDetail` is now
"responsive-friendly".  I upgraded Jane.

Note that yesterday we had this::

    general1a = """
    summary id:6
    user end_user
    site ticket_type 
    description
    """

And I said that "summary id:6" is equivalent to "summary:50 id:6" but
that was wrong, actually it is "summary:21 id:6".  The default
:attr:`preferred_width` for a
:class:`lino.core.elems.CharFieldelement` is ``1 + min(20, max(3,
self.field.max_length or 0))``, so for fields having `max_length` 20
or more the preferred default width is 21.
