A typical production release with migration
===========================================

I released my yesterday's changes for :ticket:`2490` to the
:ref:`tera` production site because Vera will appreciate it when she
will continue to enter purchase invoices in a few hours.

It needs a data migration because we have a new database model
:class:`lino_xl.lib.ledger.LedgerInfo`.


Here is a summary of how a release with data migration goes::

    $ go spz
    $ ./make_snapshot.sh
    $ tail log/lino.log
    201808-17 04:46:27 INFO [kernel 11546 140199822489344] : Started manage.py dump2py snapshot (using prod_sites.spz.settings) --> PID 11546
    201808-17 04:52:29 INFO [dump2py 11546 140199822489344] : Wrote 525610 objects to .../prod_sites/spz/snapshot/restore.py and siblings.
    201808-17 04:52:29 INFO [kernel 11546 140199822489344] : Done manage.py dump2py snapshot (PID 11546)

So a :cmd:`pm dump2py` takes 6 minutes.

But that's not the big one.  The big one is this::
  
    $ nohup time python manage.py run snapshot/restore.py --noinput &

This process lasts about 2 hours. I can close the remote terminal and
run the following command on my local terminal to see what it's
doing::

  ssh user@example.com -p 2345 tail -f .../prod_sites/spz/nohup.out


Smart quotes
=============

The `book` project has a file :xfile:`docutils.conf` with this content::

    [parsers]
    smart_quotes: false

That's because smart quotes somehow cause problems to Sphinx::

    writing output... [  0%] about/auth

        (pagename, exc))
    ThemeError: An error happened in rendering the page about/auth.
    Reason: AttributeError("'NoneType' object has no attribute 'replace'",)


Make Lino installable via pip
=============================

I am profoundly happy.  Yesterday evening Hamza and I fixed a problem
which had been waiting for *years*.  I speak about :ticket:`2347`. I
don't want to know how many hours I have been working on this issue.
I actually stopped working on it some years ago.  Hamza worked on it
37 hours (according to :ref:`jane`).  Okay it is not yet *fully* fixed
(:manage:`runserver` doesn't yet find the static files, and then we
need to implement and document the regular release procedure), but the
main issue is done.  Cool!

I remember two moments yesterday with Hamza where I laughed.  Hamza
asked "Why do you laugh?".  These moments we when I realized how
complex it all is.  I had been believing that `pip --index-url` could
simply accept a local path as source for the packages. Yes, it does,
but the path must also contain a series of html files as described in
:pep:`503`.



A new task list for Lino Avanti

Places without type
===================

And here is a subtle bug::
