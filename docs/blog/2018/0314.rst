=========================

I updated our `jobs page <https://www.saffre-rumma.net/jobs/>`_ and
reviewed some pages of the :ref:`book`.

Edmund told me how upgrade the LibreOffice on my machine::

    sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:libreoffice/ppa && sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y && sudo apt clean

Worked like a charm!    

I upgraded :ref:`jane`. I remembered vaguely that there was some
manual migration to do, but didn't even try to check my changes after
the last upgrade, simply did :xfile:`make_snapshot.sh` and then
:xfile:`restore.py`, which told me that I had removed the
`Comment.published` field from the database.

I also had a warning which I didn't investigate deeper::
  
  django/db/backends/mysql/base.py:101: Warning: (1265L, u"Data truncated for column 'regular_hours' at row 1")

Some optimizations in :ref:`noi` while sending our service reports for
February.

- ServiceReports.insert_layout
- Session.set_widget_options('break_time', hide_sum=True)
- cal.Room now inherits from users.TimezoneHolder Which has the
  challenge that TzH defines a chooser with a context argument
  "partner". cal.Room does have a property "partner", but Lino doesn't
  support this. It says AttributeError: 'property' object has no
  attribute 'name'.
  
- New field Session.room  
- There was a place in working.models.welcome_messages where we still
  passed a lazily translated text as child of an ET element.
