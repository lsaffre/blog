I filled one of the missing pieces in the Developer's Guide and wrote
the :ref:`dev.table_summaries` page.  I also wrote sections
:ref:`slave_tables` and :ref:`slave_panels`.

At the same time I did two API changes (:ticket:`1602`) which have
been waiting to get done for years:

- I renamed :meth:`get_slave_summary
  <lino.core.actors.Actor.get_slave_summary>` to
  :meth:`get_table_summary <lino.core.actors.Actor.get_table_summary>`

- I renamed :attr:`slave_grid_format
  <lino.core.tables.Table.slave_grid_format>` to :attr:`display_mode
  <lino.core.tables.Table.display_mode>`


I recovered an old hidden tutorial to a page of the developer's guide:
:ref:`lino.tutorial.matrix`.  But don't read it now; it needs more
work.
