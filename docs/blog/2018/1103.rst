==========================

There was a oneliner bug in Jane (:ref:`Noi 1.11 <noi.v18.11>`) which
took me almost half an hour to find.  The
:class:`lino_xl.lib.tickets.MySites` table still was showing *all*
sites (I wanted it to hide sleeping and closed sites).

After fixing the bug I realized that this is still not a solution to
my original problem, which is that I don't want to have to manually
subscribe to every new site in order to see it in the My sites list.
That's a difference between me and Tonis or Hamza.

Lino Tera ready for next meeting
================================

I released :ref:`tera` to their site and did more manual tests.

- emptyText "Quick search"

- Problem with deploying the changed detail_layout for EventTypes to
  their site.  Might be caused by the symbolic 'prod' link,
