This week-end I was on `Vormsi
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vormsi>`__ island where I met `Jean-Luc
Thomas <http://www.jeanlucthomas.com>`__, a professional flute player
and traveller.  We talked about how similar our work is.  Jean-Luc
noted that the fingers of a programmer on a keyboard move in quite a
similar way as those of a flute player.  A musician trains parts of
his body to use some music instrument as a tool in order to cause some
moments of happiness to the listeners.  An application programmer uses
software tools in order to help people doing their work in a better or
more efficient way, causing movements of happiness similar to those
experiencend by people when they listen to music.  Developing
application software maybe depends less on physical skills, but
otherwise both arts are very similar.

In my `amateur video <https://youtu.be/Wq2frimilyw>`__ you can see
Jean-Luc Thomas on Vormsi island, improvising with Cathy Sommer and
other talharpa players from Estonia and Finland.
