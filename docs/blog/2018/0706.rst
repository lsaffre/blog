Released timtools 2.0.0
=======================

Ta-daa, timtools version 2 is out: :ref:`tt2_0_0`.

It wasn't easy because the last release was in September 2010 and
quite some things had changed since then.  For example at that time I
was still using Windows as operating system (something I barely can
believe today).

This release is still under Python 2.  Which means that I can do it in
my old Windows XP virtual machine.  Some problems I encountered and
how I fixed them.

Installing pyinstaller::

    t:\hgwork\tt> pip install pyinstaller

    Downloading/unpacking pywin32>=223 (from pypiwin32->pyinstaller)
      Could not find any downloads that satisfy the requirement pywin32>=223 (from pypiwin32->pyinstaller)
    Cleaning up...
    No distributions at all found for pywin32>=223 (from pypiwin32->pyinstaller)
    Storing debug log for failure in T:\DATA\LUC\HOME\pip\pip.log

Aha, this is because pip support is experimental.  I downloaded
`pywin32-223.win32-py2.7.exe` and installed this one.


Another challenge was that I want to deploy several scripts in a
single zip file.  I saw that Felix-neko asked on github `#2547
<https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/2547>`__:

    I'm developing a Python package and have about 10 demo Python scripts
    that show its capabilities.  I want to distribute the demo scripts
    with PyInstaller: create 10 exe files and put them in one folder with
    all libraries they depend on.  Can it be somehow supported?

tallforasmurf answered:    

    You are describing the multipackage feature which is currently
    broken. See `#1527
    <https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/1527>`__ and
    feel free to help investigate and fix.

htgoebel suggested:

    Why not simply copy all dist/* directories into the same
    destination directory. This costs a bit of space, but solves the
    problem.

To which Felix-neko answered:

    Well, just now we are using it as a temporary workaround, but it
    look a bit too ugly even for us...


Since `#1527
<https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/1527>`__ looks
rather active and rather technical, I won't dive into this now but try
the bold approach suggested by htgoebel.

Then I still needed to change the Python code because of
runtime-errors like these::

    T:\hgwork\tt\dist\timtools>prnprint.exe
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "timtools\scripts\prnprint.py", line 7, in <module>
      File "c:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\PyInstaller\loader\pyimod03_importers.py", line 396, in load_m
    odule

      File "timtools\__init__.py", line 15, in <module>
    IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'T:\\hgwork\\tt\\dist\\timtools\\timtools\\project_inf
    o.py'
    [1536] Failed to execute script prnprint


When these problems were fixed, another problem became visible: PIL
somehow was missing or did not get bundled.  I think I fixed this by
simply installing PIL into the environment.

I tested the new timtools on their TIM by trying to print a table view
using :kbd:`SHIFT+F7`, which seems to work::

I wrote documentation and added a file :file:`mkdist.bat`.
I adapted the Sphinx config for the documentation.
I configured and activated the subdomain
http://timtools.lino-framework.org/

I published everything to https://github.com/lsaffre/timtools


Trying to add disk space to a vps
=================================

I followed the guide `Create and configure an additional disk on an
instance
<https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/public-cloud/create_and_configure_an_additional_disk_on_an_instance/>`__.
The guide needs a fuzzy reading because it is written for the old
control panel.

I selected a 50GB disk for 1.94â‚¬/month.

In a first attempt I created a disk in Warsaw (the suggested default
location), but when I wanted to attach it to a server, the control
panel said "You have no compatible instance that you can attach this
volume to".  I deleted my disk in Warsaw and created a new one in
Strasbourg.

Before::

    luc@ovh2:~$ lsblk
    NAME   MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
    sda      8:0    0  10G  0 disk 
    `-sda1   8:1    0  10G  0 part /

After::
  
    luc@ovh2:~$ lsblk
    NAME   MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
    sda      8:0    0  10G  0 disk 
    `-sda1   8:1    0  10G  0 part /
    sdb      8:16   0  50G  0 disk 

I run fdisk to change the partition table of my new disk::

    $ sudo fdisk /dev/sdb

First I ask it to create a new partition::    
    
    Command (m for help): n
    Partition type
       p   primary (0 primary, 0 extended, 4 free)
       e   extended (container for logical partitions)
    Select (default p): 

    Using default response p.
    Partition number (1-4, default 1): 
    First sector (2048-104857599, default 2048): 
    Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G,T,P} (2048-104857599, default 104857599): 

    Created a new partition 1 of type 'Linux' and of size 50 GiB.

Now I tell fdisk to write my partition table and exit::

    Command (m for help): w
    The partition table has been altered.
    Calling ioctl() to re-read partition table.
    Syncing disks.
    
Then I format my new partition::

    luc@ovh2:~$ sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
    mke2fs 1.42.12 (29-Aug-2014)
    Discarding device blocks: done                            
    Creating filesystem with 13106944 4k blocks and 3276800 inodes
    Filesystem UUID: 4e8d6d43-9e7d-4e16-a23c-4aa50076c826
    Superblock backups stored on blocks: 
            32768, 98304, 163840, 229376, 294912, 819200, 884736, 1605632, 2654208, 
            4096000, 7962624, 11239424

    Allocating group tables: done                            
    Writing inode tables: done                            
    Creating journal (32768 blocks): done
    Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done

I manually mount the partition for a first time::

    luc@ovh2:~$ sudo mkdir /mnt/disk
    luc@ovh2:~$ sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/disk/
    
I note my block device IDs::

    luc@ovh2:~$ sudo blkid
    /dev/sda1: UUID="d0762fba-e9b1-4692-b20c-26b6daf0f119" TYPE="ext4" PARTUUID="4585c18d-01"
    /dev/sdb1: UUID="4e8d6d43-9e7d-4e16-a23c-4aa50076c826" TYPE="ext4" PARTUUID="7cf937be-01"
    

I add the disk to the :file:`/etc/fstab` file in order to have it
mounted automatically at startup. Before::

    /dev/sda1  /  ext4  errors=remount-ro,discard  0  1

After::  
    
    UUID=d0762fba-e9b1-4692-b20c-26b6daf0f119 /  ext4  errors=remount-ro,discard  0  1
    UUID=4e8d6d43-9e7d-4e16-a23c-4aa50076c826 /mnt/disk ext4 nofail 0 0

IOW I also switched to UUID for my :file:`/dev/sda1` which seems
to be a more robust way to name devices

And now::

  $ sudo reboot

And then as a first step I moved `public_html` to the new disk
(leaving a symbolic link to the new location so I don't need to change
any related configuration files).
