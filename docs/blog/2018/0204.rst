I read `Swiss bishop signs statement calling Pope’s reading of Amoris
Laetitia “alien” to the Catholic Faith
<https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/swiss-bishop-signs-statement-calling-popes-reading-of-amoris-laetitia-alien>`__.
Yes, that's as expected.  The rats are leaving the ship.  They are
doing it in a noisy way which might cause some fears among the sheep.
But let's hope that it doesn't cause too much damage.  And anyway
there is no reason to be afraid.  Trust in the Pope and show your
trust by signing `pro-pope-francis
