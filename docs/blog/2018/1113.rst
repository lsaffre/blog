==========================

I continued the work I started on :doc:`Saturday <1110>` ticket
:ticket:`2651` (Invoicing in :ref:`tera`).

Yes, neither presences nor calendar entries (:class:`cal.Guest` or
:class:`cal.Event`) are :class:`lino_xl.lib.invoicing.Invoiceable`,
but enrolment (:class:`lino_tera.lib.courses.Enrolment`).  Because not
every presence is invoiceable, and only the enrolment (and its
dossier) can decide this.  There are dossiers for whom they invoice a
maximum number of presences per month, if they come more often then
it's free. For family therapies they don't invoice per presence but
per calendar entry.

So I generalized the invoicing logic we had in :ref:`voga`.

How to mark notifications as seen
=================================

I opened :ticket:`2664` and updated :ref:`book.specs.notify`.


Apps aren't loaded yet
======================

I opened :ticket:`2665` because with my uncommited changes, :cmd:`inv
bd` in the book fails when autodoc tries to import
:mod:`lino_care.lib.tickets.workflows`.
