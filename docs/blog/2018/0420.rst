======================

I checked in a few minor optimizations:

- A new function :func:`show_choicelist
  <lino.api.doctest.show_choicelist>` and its helper
  :func:`str2languages <lino.api.doctest.str2languages>`
      
- The new class attribute :attr:`old2new
  <lino.core.choicelists.ChoiceList.old2new>` is used by
  :class:`BeIdCardTypes <lino_xl.lib.beid.BeIdCardTypes>`.  Until now
  we stored the types 1 and 6 with values "1" and "6". But as
  :ref:`eidreader` revealed, the raw value on the cards is "01" and
  "06".
      
- The :mod:`lino.core.user_types` wasn't yet visible in the API.

- I converted :ref:`specs.lib.beid` from source to prosa (i.e. they
  move from the `xl` repository to the `book` repository).
