=========================

I checked in a series of changes for :ticket:`2687`.  Details in
:ref:`welcht.18.12.0`.

I updated the release notes for :ref:`lino.18.11.0` and  released them on PyPI.

I removed lino and lino_xl from the :file:`requirements.stable.txt` in
:ref:`book`.  Which means that we are "forced" to publish a new release on PyPI
whenever there is some change in one of these packages required by an
application.  Just to increase our consciousness of the difference between the
"framework" and the "applications".  Our new collaboration directives say that
customers don't pay for maintenance of the core (unless it "more efficient" to
implement in the core).
