Reactivating the **lino-developers** mailing list
=================================================

Yesterday Abdelkader asked me two questions via Hangouts. My problem
with giving 1:1 support on HO is that nobody else can see it.  And
that's a pity because Abdelkader's questions are *as such* already a
valuable contribution to the Lino project.

The `lino-developers
<http://lino-framework.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/lino-developers>`__
mailing list created in 2015 was meant to fix that problem.  I think
it is time to activate it.  I remind what I wrote on this list in
`December 2015
<http://lino-framework.org/pipermail/lino-developers/2015-December/000011.html>`__:

    I suggest that you all try to use this list when talking with me
    about Lino so that the others have a chance to participate. This
    list is not meant as a newsletter but as a discussion forum, so
    please don't fear to ask stupid questions. This list is not meant
    for non-technical stakeholders, so don't hesitate to speak openly
    about problems and criticize things you dislike.

This list had a little problem: the public archives
(http://lino-framework.org/pipermail/lino-developers/) were not
visible.  When you went there, Apache told you:

    **Forbidden**

    You don't have permission to access /pipermail/lino-developers/ on
    this server.

The problem was a missing ``x`` permission for ``others`` on the
archives directory `as explained here
<https://mail.python.org/pipermail/mailman-users/2011-February/071144.html>`__,
and here is how I fixed it::

    $ sudo ls -ld /var/lib/mailman/archives/private/
    drwxrws--- 48 list list 4096 Apr 26  2016 /var/lib/mailman/archives/private/
    $ sudo chmod o+x /var/lib/mailman/archives/private/
    $ sudo ls -ld /var/lib/mailman/archives/private/
    drwxrws--x 48 list list 4096 Apr 26  2016 /var/lib/mailman/archives/private/

Yes the Mailman layout is not very modern.  But it works and is mature
technology...
