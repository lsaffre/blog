======================

I fixed :ticket:`2348` (Output of doctest.show_fields() differs
(Python 2*3)).  This was not an easy one.  It seems that the sort
order of the 3 virtual fields defined on
:class:`lino.core.model.Model` (:attr:`workflow_buttons` etc) was not
correct under Python 2. As a workaround I added an option `all=False`
to :func:`lino.api.show_fields` which hides fields that have no
`help_text`.  Of course this caused some existing test snippets to
fail.  And *en passant* I updated some help texts.
