Uff! Yesterday (and now) I finally got my work of the last 10 days
committed and pushed and the test suites to pass and the docs to
build.

There was a problem (:ticket:`2665`) for building the book after above
changes.  I had to remove ``workflows`` and ``models`` from the
:rst:dir:`autosummary` directives of
:mod:`lino_vilma.lib.vilma` and
:mod:`lino_noi.lib.noi`.

Prosa docs :mod:`lino_noi.lib.noi.workflows` and
:mod:`lino_vilma.lib.vilma.workflows` still don't seem it seems to
work.  To be continued. Not urgent.
