Why EIDRreader fails from behind a tunnel
=========================================

I create a tunnel from port 8080 of my 127.0.0.1 to their server using::

    ssh -L 8080:custlino.example.com:80 johndoe@example.com

In my :file:`/etc/hosts` I have::

  127.0.0.1   custlino

Then I open a browser on http://custlino:8080 to access their server.

I have installed :ref:`eidreader`.

In my browser I then ask to read an id card. The beid protocol handler
will be called with a URL that looks like this::

    beid://http://custlino:8080/eid/1234-5678-abcd

EIDRreader removes the "beid://" prefix and then uses the requests
package which in turn uses the socket package which in the end will do
something like this:

>>> import socket
>>> url = "custlino"
>>> socket.getaddrinfo(url, 8080)
[(2, 1, 6, '', ('127.0.0.1', 8080)), (2, 2, 17, '', ('127.0.0.1', 8080)), (2, 3, 0, '', ('127.0.0.1', 8080))]

>>> import requests

So EIDRreader finally will post to 127.0.0.1.

Maybe I just need to add '127.0.0.1' to :setting:`ALLOWED_HOSTS` on
their server?  No, this wasn't a solution.  To be continued.
