I removed the logger message that caused the failure on `travis
yesterday
<https://travis-ci.org/lino-framework/book/jobs/381822652>`__


This morning I had an idea how to fix :ticket:`2395`.  Instead of
using the object's hash as id for the callback, we simply use its
hexadecimal representation. This representation is technically a
string. We don't need the ``0x`` prefix.  Thanks to `this discussion
on SO
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10218164/how-to-convert-an-integer-to-hexadecimal-without-the-extra-0x-leading-and-l>`__
about how to remove it.


I tried nuitka on :ref:`eidreader`::

    $ p3
    $ pip install nuitka
    $ python -m nuitka --recurse-all scripts/eidreader
