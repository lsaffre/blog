:ticket:`2296` ({'system_note_type': [u"L'instance Event Type avec 1
dans id n'existe pas."]}) is again visible.  I tried to remove the
custom object manager on SiteConfig (real_objects) because it is a
possible cause of side effects.  But that didn't fix the problem, and
it caused a test failure which helped me to understand why this hack
is needed.

I added a table :class:`SitesByReport
<lino_xl.lib.working.SitesByReport>` to :mod:`lino_xl.lib.working`.
Because for some clients we now have several sites, and we want to see
the sums of working hours per site.
