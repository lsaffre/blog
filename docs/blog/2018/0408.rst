Command-line program for reading data from a Belgian eid card
=============================================================

Yesterday I arrived in Eupen.  I posted some pictures in my `private
blog <http://luc.saffre-rumma.net/blog/2018/0407.html>`__.

I hope to get my own Belgian ID card activated tomorrow, but today a
friend gave me his Belgian ID card for testing, so I could continue
the work on :ticket:`2089` started on :doc:`0403`.  It gets the names
correctly, but issues twice the following question:

  The application [/media/dell1tb/virtualenvs/py3/bin/python3] wants
  to access the eID card. Do you want to accept it?

And at the command-line I get this (real names replaced by my names)::

    $ python eid-data.py 
    cryptokiVersion: 2.11
    flags: 
    libraryDescription: Belgium eID PKCS#11 interface v2
    libraryVersion: 4.1
    manufacturerID: Belgium Government              
    ======================================================
    Error: CKR_TOKEN_NOT_PRESENT (0x000000E0)

Okay, this needs more investigation, e.g. read Ludovic Rousseau's
`PyKCS11 introduction

-- but not today!
