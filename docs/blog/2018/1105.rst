========================

I realized that the *user manuals* (the doctrees tera_de, welfare_de,
welfare_fr and noi) should have a repository on their own instead of
being part of the `book <https://github.com/lino-framework/book>`__.

The Lino Book should remain English-only docs about Lino in general.
I created a new repository `manuals
<https://github.com/lino-framework/manuals>`__ for end-user docs.

Note that `manuals <https://github.com/lino-framework/manuals>`__
*does contain a test suite*.  In other words, also Tonis and Hamza
must get a clone of the manuals repository and add it to their
projects.

What then is the difference between `manuals/noi` and
`book/specs/noi`?

Rule of thumb: The *specs* are for application developers, the
*manual* is for end-users.

The doctests in a manual should limit to code that make sense to an
end-user, for example:

- :func:`rt.show <lino.core.requests.BaseRequest.show>`
- :func:`show_menu_path <lino.api.doctest.show_menu_path>`
- :func:`show_quick_search_fields <lino.api.doctest.show_quick_search_fields>`


Fixed a Python 3 failure in book
================================

The problem was mostly that
:meth:`lino.modlib.notify.Message.emit_notification`
uses a set to remove potential duplicate recipients.
