I have been wondering why Abdelkader did have to ask the two questions
he asked yesterday.  Because theoretically they were answered in the
developer's guide, but he obviously didn't find them, or if he read
them before asking, they were not clear enough.

As a result of my meditations I moved three pages from
:ref:`dev.acquaintained` to :ref:`dev.diving`: :ref:`dev.menu`
:ref:`virtualfields` and :ref:`actions`.
And I moved :ref:`dev.lets` in the other direction.

Otherwise it's clear that the pages under :ref:`dev.diving` lack
concrete code examples.  A newbie is probably overwhelmed with too
much dry theory.  That's not a trivial issue because good code
examples (1) are difficult to write and (2) should be tested.

I saw that Abdelkader is using :meth:`__str__` to compute and set some
values of a database object. He obviously doesn't know about the
:meth:`full_clean` method.  I added documentation about in
:ref:`dev.models`.  Which caused me to write a new method
:meth:`lino.core.iste.Site.format_currency`.

Other ideas are haunting my brain must wait until I have more time:

- per-plugin migrators
- country-based names for the fictive persons and companies in the
  contacts fictures.
