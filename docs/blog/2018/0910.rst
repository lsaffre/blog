Today I have still be documenting and tidying up before pushing my
work on the new accounting report.


More SQL summaries
==================

I had some work with :ref:`specs.tera.sql`.  Since there is no more
virtual table `ledger.AccountingReport`, I thought Okay let's analyze
the SQL generated by
:meth:`lino_xl.lib.sheets.Report.run_update_plan`.  Oops, our
:func:`lino.api.doctest.show_sql_summary` didn't yet swallow INSERT
INTO and DELETE FROM statements.

This is where I searched for "Python SQL parser" and found `sqlparse
<https://sqlparse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.

>>> import sqlparse
>>> sql = "SELECT a, b, c FROM foo WHERE bar = 5;"
>>> parsed = sqlparse.parse(sql)
>>> for stmt in parsed:
...     print(stmt)
SELECT a, b, c FROM foo WHERE bar = 5;
>>> stmt = parsed[0]
>>> print(stmt.get_type())
SELECT

>>> for token in stmt:
...     print token.__class__, token
<class 'sqlparse.sql.Token'> SELECT
<class 'sqlparse.sql.Token'>  
<class 'sqlparse.sql.IdentifierList'> a, b, c
<class 'sqlparse.sql.Token'>  
<class 'sqlparse.sql.Token'> FROM
<class 'sqlparse.sql.Token'>  
<class 'sqlparse.sql.Identifier'> foo
<class 'sqlparse.sql.Token'>  
<class 'sqlparse.sql.Where'> WHERE bar = 5;

>>> sql = "SELECT COUNT(*) AS __count FROM foo WHERE bar = 5;"
>>> parsed = sqlparse.parse(sql)
>>> stmt = parsed[0]
>>> for token in stmt:
...     print token.__class__, token



Corporate-driven open source
============================

This reminds me Brett Cannon's blog post `Setting expectations for
open source participation
<https://snarky.ca/setting-expectations-for-open-source-participation/>`__
where he writes "For a day job I am the dev lead for the `Python
extension for Visual Studio Code
<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python>`__. Originally
the extension was an `open source, personal project
<https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pythonVSCode>`__, but then Microsoft
decided it would be a good idea to support the most popular extension
for VS Code, so we hired its creator (Don Jayamanne), put me on the
team, and then we re-launched the extension as an `official open
source project from Microsoft
<https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python>`__ (and now we are a team
of four developers and a product manager). So I participate in what I
would call *corporate open source* for a living because even if we
never received a single outside contribution ever again, the
extension's development will continue thanks to Microsoft."
