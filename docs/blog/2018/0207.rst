Today I had my first meeting on slack with the team of ajapaik.

We worked on `More efficient way to delete dummy users.
<https://trello.com/c/jum5ns5v/125-more-efficient-way-to-delete-dummy-users>`__,
more precisely we want to optimize the `delete_zero_data_users.py
<https://github.com/Ajapaik/ajapaik-web/blob/develop/project/ajapaik/management/commands/delete_zero_data_users.py>`__
script.
