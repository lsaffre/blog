I fixed `two trivial failures
<https://travis-ci.org/lino-framework/book/jobs/382975383>`__ in
:ref:`book`.

In order to comply with the GDPR, I reviewed our `confidentiality
statement form
<http://www.saffre-rumma.net/dl/confidentiality_statement.pdf>`__ and
deactivated :ref:`jane` users for whom I don't have that statement.
As the responsible site admin for Jane I know that I can trust all
these users, but the GDPR made me realize that indeed trust is not
enough, I must also have a valid proof.
