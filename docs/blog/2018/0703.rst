A new version of the TIM tools
==============================

I continued to work on :ticket:`2352` (E-Mail aus TIM raus : Kodierung
falsch seit neuer GW). The problem is because the :cmd:`timtools
openmail` command :func:`timtools.tools.mail.openmail` uses which
encodes the content using a hard-coded encoding::

    text = text.encode("iso-8859-1","replace")

I simply changed this to::    
    
    text = text.encode("utf-8", "replace")

We could of course make it configurable, but I guess that anyway this
production site is the only user.  The real problem is that we must
now build a new timtools release.  The last release was somewhere in
2009, and the environment I used then no longer exeists, and McMillian
installer no longer exists.  I plan to do it as I did with
:ref:`eidreader`.

     
The daily planner for calendar plugin
=========================================

I finished adapting the test suites after my changes for
:ticket:`2382` (Rendez-vous ext√©rieurs visibles pour l'accueil) and
now finally pushed my changes to the public repositories.
