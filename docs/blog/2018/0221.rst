remove blog, extend comments
============================

I am considering to undo the changes I did for :ticket:`2327`, at
least partially.  The `published` timestamp was a mistake. Why I
started them:

I see that Tonis manages well with writing comments: at certain
moments (usually either at the beginning or at the end of a session)
he takes the time of describing what he has done, or plans to do,
which problems he encountered, open questions, ...  And I thought "How
can I get myself to also type comments into Jane instead of writing my
blog?"  It seems that I am different: I use my editor for thinking, I
think while I am writing. I want to have a kind of draft of my notes
of a workday.

Idea: replace the `published` timestamp by a `state`.  I can imagine
three comment states in Jane:

- Draft (don't notify the others)
- Open (notify others, and I am waiting for a reply)
- Closed (notify others, but just fyi)

In Avanti they would have only one state, and we would hide the state
field (and workflow_buttons).

In other application I can imagine more states, e.g. comments might
require approval by a moderator, or the author can hide or withdraw
them.
  
The state field would be in the insert_layout so that I can set it to
Draft.  Maybe a default value for this field in the user preferences.
