Jane optimizations october 2018
===============================

I had an avalanche of ideas for Jane.  I documented them in
:ref:`noi.changes.201810` and then did them...  fully alone... not
very good teamwork...  OTOH it is more efficient to discuss things
when there is a concrete suggestion.  And it is easy to revert any of
the changes I did today, so I'd rather consider them as a suggestion.
Yes a quite bold one.  But in Wikipedia they also recommend to `be
bold <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Be_bold>`__ and to not
fear changing things if you feel that they need to change.
