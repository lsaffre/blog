Fill-Paragraph in PyCharm
=========================

`This video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9E59SqAGkU>`__ shows why I move
only now from Emacs to PyCharm. They are aware of the problem, it is `issue
#2737 <https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/issues/2737>`__. The
Solution seems to be a plugin `WrapToColumn
<https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7234-wrap-to-column>`__.

I learned `how to install a plugin
<https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/2018.2/managing-plugins.html#installing-plugins-from-disk>`__
and `how to set the margin to 79
<https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/206598165-How-to-change-margin-width->`__.
And in :menuselection:`File --> Settings --> Keymap` I assigned the
:kbd:`Alt+Q` key to the WrapParagrqaphToColumn action.

Now I can finally start to feel at home in PyCharm.


Yet another user manual
=======================

I think we need another user manual (in the :ref:`manuals` repository) : lino.
This will contain (1) release notes of Lino and XL to PyPI and (2) Topics for
site administrators, e.g. user management, notification framework, printing
