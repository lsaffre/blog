Harry asked to limit the choice list of a time field to a normal work
time (from 7:00 to 22:00) instead of showing ranges from 0:00 to
23:45.  This was less trivial than I assumed because Lino didn't yet
have a possibility to configure this.  So here we have a new feature:
Lino can now let you configure the start and the end time of a work
day.  We have two new Site settings :attr:`calendar_start_hour
<lino.core.site.Site.calendar_start_hour>` and
:attr:`calendar_end_hour <lino.core.site.Site.calendar_end_hour>`, and
a new field :class:`TimeField <lino.core.fields.TimeField>`.
