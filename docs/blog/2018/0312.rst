I released etgen version 0.0.4 because of failures on :ref:`travis`
like `this one
<https://travis-ci.org/lino-framework/xl/builds/352026976?utm_source=email&utm_medium=notification>`__
in packages which don't declare a github snapshot in their
:xfile:`requirements.txt`.


I continued to repair the test suite of :ref:`welfare` after my
changes for :ticket:`2330` and :ticket:`2333`.

There is a subtlety to be considered when a plugin A is automatically
being installed because it is needed by a plugin B which is itself
being installed automatically because needed by a third plugin C: In
this case, :meth:`A.get_menu_group
<lino.core.plugins.Plugin.get_menu_group>` should return C (and not
B).

A case where this happens is :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.pcsw` which
needs :mod:`lino_xl.lib.coachings` which in turn needs
:mod:`lino_xl.lib.clients`.
