Tonis and I worked on :ticket:`2232` (sepa.uppercasefield_widget fails
in use_django_forms branch).

Before checking my work in I'd like to run the test suite...

...but there is a strange failure::

    $ doctest docs/specs/noi/bs3.rst
    **********************************************************************
    File "book/docs/specs/noi/bs3.rst", line 33, in bs3.rst
    Failed example:
        res = test_client.get('/tickets/Ticket/13')
    Expected nothing
    Got:
        (<WSGIRequest: GET '/tickets/Ticket/13'>, u'tickets', u'Ticket', u'13')


Looks as if :meth:`django.test.Client.get` now outputs to
stdout. Tonis, do you remember having added a debug message recently?
