Make Lino installable using pip
===============================

Yesterday in a hangout with Hamza we continued to work on
:ticket:`2347`.  Now I will repair the test suite.  I see that for the
cosi_ee demo project there are now estonian places missing.

I showed to Hamza what I previously had written in
:ref:`user.install`.  We observed that :cmd:`inv prep` took very long.
I now realized the reason for this: the :mod:`demo_bookings` fixture
causes many bookings, and especially if you don't also specify
:attr:`the_demo_date <lino.core.site.Site.the_demo_date>`.  I changed
the default :attr:`demo_fixtures <lino.core.site.Site.demo_fixtures>`
for :ref:`cosi` (defined in :mod:`lino_cosi.lib.cosi.settings`):
removed `demo_bookings` and `payments` from default value because
these caused :cmd:`inv prep` to be very slow in :ref:`user.install`.

There are three demo
projects for :ref:`cosi` in the book: apc, pierre and cosi_ee I now
realized that my changes in these three projects were wrong. I changed
the :file:`settings/demo.py` files but actually their
:file:`settings/__init__.py` files did already define their own
:attr:`demo_fixtures`.

Also we removed :mod:`lino_xl.lib.mailbox` from default lino_noi and
added it manually in the team demo project.  This change caused a
failure in :ref:`admin.linod` because sequence order of installed apps
has changed for :mod:`lino_book.projects.team`.


Backup my own data
==================

It seems that DejaDup backup simply fails for me because it takes more
than a night on my notebook. And I don't see how I can verify what's
on a backup.  I turn back to good old rsync. First I move 23 GB of
Kusta's data from the external Touro disk to the archive on doll. Then
I adapted my :file:`~/bin/backup2exthdd.sh` file.
