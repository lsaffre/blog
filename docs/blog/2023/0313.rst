======================

I worked on :ticket:`4898` (Change "site operator" to "site owner", add a field
site_maintainer and render them both in the local help pages.)

Changes:

- New database model :class:`help.SiteContacts`



Side effects
- :ticket:`4902`
- Removed the apcdocs directory



Side effects:

- :meth:`contacts.Person.as_paragraph` no longer inserts a ``<br>`` between the
  salutation and the title & name

TODO:

- adapt test suites
- write documentation
- translations
- Define :meth:`SiteContact.as_paragraph` and :meth:`SiteContact.__str__`
- Add link the help pages in publisher main page.
- Several test cases still failing

failing test cases::

  docs/dev/site_internals.rst
  docs/projects/noi1r.rst
  docs/specs/polls.rst
  docs/tested/dashboard_sql.rst  # there is one group membership more in noi1r
  docs/specs/react/linoweb.rst
  docs/specs/migrate.rst
  docs/specs/jinja.rst
  docs/specs/households.rst
