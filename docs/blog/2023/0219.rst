The book test suite still has 7 failures because when I was waiting for my local
test suite to finish I discovered :ref:`lino.tutorial.input_mask` and
accidentally started to work on this and pushed an untested last-minute change:
the :mod:`lino_react.react` plugin no longer depends on :mod:`lino.modlib.memo`.
