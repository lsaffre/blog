(Just some draft thoughts. Continued on :doc:`0607`.)

Some storage states:

== ========================= =======================
01 auf Lager                 in stock
02 bestellt vom Kunden       reserved for customer
03 bestellt bei Lieferant    ordered from provider
04 ausgeliehen               rented out
05 besch√§digt                damaged
06 in Reparatur              under repair
07 gekauft                   purchased
== ========================= =======================

In Lino Noi we would have only on storage state "purchased", and two transfer
rules:

- A sales invoice (SLS) debits 02 and credits 06
- A service report (SRV) voucher debits 06
