I found and fixed a bug in :mod:`lino.utils.quantities` : Lino sometimes
produced nonsense when working with :ref:`negative durations
<negative_durations>`.

I replaced "cooperation" and "co-operation" in the docs by "collaboration"
because I was irritated by that fact that I still can't decide which spelling I
prefer. And also after reading `this article
<https://hbr.org/2015/04/theres-a-difference-between-collaboration-and-collaboration>`__.
