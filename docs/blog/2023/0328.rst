The `bootstrap3/base.html` template has a language selector and I think that we
actually want to to use this logic for publisher as well. And `page.pub.html` is
based on this template, but overrides the ``header`` block. The bootstrap
language selector uses :class:`lino.core.requests.BaseRequest.get_request_url`,
which currently doesn't work for a publisher page. Solution was to write a
Renderer for publisher, and reimplement the publisher views.

I tried to find a better place for the `hash_router` and `permalink_uris`
attributes of :class:`lino.core.requests.BaseRequest`.

- `hash_router` is used in :meth:`lino.core.renderer.HtmlRenderer.get_permalink`
  to insert the "#" sign before the URL. This information is constant for the
  react front end and shouldn't be stored on each incoming request.

- ``permalink_uris`` is used in
  :meth:`lino.core.renderer.HtmlRenderer.row_action_button`
  :meth:`lino.core.renderer.JsRenderer.obj2url`

The ``hash_router`` attribute was used only by the publisher view, which I
reimplemented. So it can go away.

But :attr:`lino.core.requests.BaseRequest.permalink_uris` stays.
