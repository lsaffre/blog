Sites with multiple front ends
==============================

I removed :attr:`Plugin.force_url_prefix` because it was unused.

Specifying :attr:`Site.default_ui` is now "the old way".  The attribute
:attr:`default_ui` on the Kernel (which was the :class:`Plugin` instance of the
plugin named by `Site.default_ui`) is no replaced by  an attribute
:attr:`web_front_ends`.

To use the new feature, you can now set the :attr:`web_front_ends` on the Site,
which in that case must be a list of tuples having two items `(prefix, modname)`
each.  For example a site with react as default and extjs as alternative front
end would have::

  web_front_ends = [
    (None, "lino_react.react"),
    ('ext', "lino.modlib.extjs")]

Or in :mod:`cms1` we have publisher as default and react as the "admin" front
end::

  web_front_ends = [
    (None, "lino.modlib.publisher"),
    ('admin', "lino_react.react")]
