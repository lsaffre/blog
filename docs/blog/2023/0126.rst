==========================

I made an upgrade to Jane because I want to make the next service report using
the subscriptions.

The upgrade worked very well, Lino behaved correctly. I made a few local
bugfixes after the update (i.e. I made them both locally on the production
server and in my code):

- 2023-01-26 02:49 in *xl*:
  `c77c41c <git@gitlab.com:lino-framework/xl.git>`__
  (local bugfixes after update jane)
- 2023-01-26 02:50 in *noi*:
  `e359847 <git@gitlab.com:lino-framework/noi.git>`__
  (local bugfixes after update jane)

I then wanted to make the next service report for a guinea pig customer.

First there was no "Generate invoices" entry in the Sales menu. I marked two
journals as having an invoicing_area. This should have changed the menu, but it
didn't. I guess this is because users preferences are stored in memory. After
restarting supervisor the menu was updated.

I still didn't get Lino to suggest a service report. Something is still missing
in the configuration. To be continued next time.
