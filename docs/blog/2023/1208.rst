Yesterday I started a new :ref:`amici` production site for the "Association of
Estonian Taizé Friends", a small group of volunteers. My idea is to give them a
collaboration and file sharing platform similar to Slack or Microsoft Teams. I
am the only one to believe in this idea. I wouldn't even say that I "believe" in
it, I'd rather say I "feel a call to try" it.

Why not `Mattermost <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattermost>`__? Because
Mattermost is not really free any more. Okay, but why not `Zulip
<https://zulip.com/team/>`__? Led by Tim Abbott, Zulip seems very similar to
Lino. His wife Alya Abbott is quite good with promoting the idea (read e.g.
`When “free forever” means “free for the next 4 months”
<https://blog.zulip.com/2023/05/04/when-free-forever-is-4-months/>`__). And
Zulip has more than 1000 code contributors, their `Contributing guide
<https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/contributing.html>`__ is
obviously better than ours.

In other words, reasonably spoken, I should recommend `Zulip
<https://zulip.com/plans/>`_ to my Estonian Taizé friends rather than burdening
them with a Lino.

My problem is that reality is not always reasonable.
