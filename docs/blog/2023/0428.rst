======================

The action request on a slave table didn't always report correctly about invalid
master type. I added more examples in :ref:`book.dev.chooser2`. Fixing this
caused internal optimizations in :mod:`lino.core.requests` and
:mod:`lino.core.tablerequest`.

I generalized the :class:`lino.utils.MissingRow` idea. Until now it was used
only by :class:`lino.core.choicelists.PointingChoice`, now it is also used when
the master instance could not be found.

.. currentmodule:: lino.modlib.system

I restored the translatable texts for :class:`DurationUnits` and
:class:`Recurrencies`, which had been lost when we recently moved these classes
from :mod:`lino_xl.lib.cal` to :mod:`lino.modlib.system`

The :class:`lino.modlib.linod.BackgroundTask` now logs using DEBUG instead of INFO.
Because it causes 3 messages every 10 seconds.

I moved the :fixture:`demo` fixture for noi1e and noi1r demo projects from
:mod:`lino_book.projects.noi1e` to :mod:`lino_noi.lib.noi`. Because we want it
also on a demo server.

While working on this, I also happened to optimize content in the Developer
Guide.
