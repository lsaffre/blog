I pushed my work for :ticket:`5039` although the actual issue is not fixed.
Because I want to test everything "on the field" on two production sites (jane
and froinde). And because :ticket:`5039` has been there before, it is not a
release blocker.

I completely rewrote the :func:`lino.modlib.memo.truncate_comment` function  and
moved doctests to a `separate document
<https://dev.lino-framework.org/topics/truncate.html>`__:
:ref:`book.topics.truncate`.


The remark field in :class:`lino_xl.lib.polls.AnswerRemark` was also being
truncated by :func:`truncate_comment`, with `max_p_len` being -1. I suspect that
this was mixing up sanitizing and truncating. The remark of a poll answer needs
to be *sanitized*, not truncated. Sanitizing is done using bleach in Lino.
