I upgraded Jane. No big problem but a few smal ones.

:cmd:`pm collectstatic` failed because of three trivial regressions I introduced when I moved the
:meth:`build_site_cache` from kernel to :class:`lino.core.site.Site`.

These failures would probably have been noticed by the getlino test suite, but I
didn't look at it before releasing to pypi. And looking at it now, it is
`failing because of yet another reason
<https://gitlab.com/lino-framework/getlino/-/jobs/3747450100>`__, equally a trivial one.
I wish we had somebody who monitors the test suites on GitLab!

I also upgraded froinde, which runs on an older server under Python 3.7. Seems
that the type hints we recently started to use aren't yet supported there ::
