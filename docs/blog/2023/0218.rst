The Django docs (`How the documentation is organized
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/#how-the-documentation-is-organized>`__)
mention four top-level entry points ("Tutorials", "Topic guides", "Reference
guides" and "How-to guides"), but  it seems that I don't fully agree with that
model.

- "Guides" or "Getting started"
- "Topics" or "FAQ"
- "Reference" or "Index"

"Tutorials" and "Recipes" are documents types, not entry points.
