====================

First use case will be :ref:`noi` where customers would buy services (increasing
their stock of purchased services), and we would introduce a new journal
"Service reports", which will decrease the stock.

Until now both operations were expressed in money and within a single journal. A
same sales invoice could potentially contain the renewal of a yearly
subscription and a series of services built from working sessions. The time
credit was actually expressed in money.
Now the time credit will be expressed in hours. 1

We now have two invoicing areas:

- Sales invoices is for selling yearly subscriptions and (optionally)
  contingents of time credit.

- Service reports have no effect on accounting. They don't generate *ledger*
  movements but *storage* movements.
