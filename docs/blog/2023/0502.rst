=============================
Some optimizations in calview
=============================

Tuesday, May 2, 2023

I pushed a few days of work for :ticket:`4960`. The ``book`` and ``welfare``
test suites passed, one failure in ``presto`` intentionally left open because it
has to do with :meth:`Actor.get_title`.

Fixed bugs: In weekly view, the day numbers in the column headers are now
clickable and switch to daily view. In monthly view, the week numbers are now
clickable and switch to weekly view. The title of the slave table in the details
of the three calendar views is now empty (instead of repeating the title of the
detail window). In Presto where we have more than one planner, the daily/weekly
buttons went to the default Calendar planner instead of staying in the Workers
planner.

I reported a bug and a feature request in the React front end: :ticket:`4958`
and :ticket:`4959`

TODO:

- Filtering doesn't seem to work in the calendar views.
- Document difference between :attr:`title` and :attr:`label` of an actor
- Should :meth:`Actor.get_title` return None when both  :attr:`title` and
  :attr:`label` are None?
