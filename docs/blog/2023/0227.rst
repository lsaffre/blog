=========================

I reviewed Sharif's work. Looks good! I am looking forward to get a
presentation. I responded with two minor changes (in four commits):  (1) We
still need to support Python 3.7, so I removed a type hint in lino. (2) And then
the output of :class:`lino_xl.lib.cal.Calendars` in :ref:`book.specs.cal` was:

>>> rt.show(cal.Calendars)
... #doctest: +ELLIPSIS +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

Sharif's work had added a column "Modified", right after the ID. But we don't
want this field to be so visible!  The *code* needs to be fixed, not the test
case! This is an example where the test suite protects us from an unwanted
change in the user interface.

Here are the four commits:

- 2023-02-27 04:03 in *lino*:
  `4f61f1f <git@gitlab.com:lino-framework/lino.git>`__
  (remove type hint to support Python before 3.8)
- 2023-02-27 04:33 in *xl*:
  `b44bb78 <git@gitlab.com:lino-framework/xl.git>`__
  (add explicit column_names to cal.Calendars)
- 2023-02-27 04:35 in *xl*:
  `f895af5 <git@gitlab.com:lino-framework/xl.git>`__
  (oops add explicit column_names to cal.Calendars)
- 2023-02-27 04:36 in *book*:
  `87f8517 <git@gitlab.com:lino-framework/book.git>`__
  (adapt after adding explicit column_names to cal.Calendars)
