When a site has its calendar events, or products or users..., published as
PublisherViews, then we probably do *not* want calendar entries or users to
become an instance of :class:`pages.Node` (with fields like ``title`` and
``body``, with potential child nodes, etc). But since they (potentially)
generate a page on their own, we want them to have previous/next links. I am not
so sure any more whether these previous/next links should integrate them into a
"one and only sequence of pages". We can say that a Lino site with publisher has
one pagination suite per PublisherView.
