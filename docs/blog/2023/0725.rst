========================================
OVH is blacklisted by UCEPROTECT Level 3
========================================

Tuesday, July 25, 2023

Our main mail server, ``saffre-rumma.net``, is currently blacklisted by
UCEPROTECTL3. Which means that our IP address falls into a poor reputation
range. The entire range of IP addresses is blocked because the provider (OVH in
our case) also hosts spammers. UCEPROTECTL3 does not offer any form of manual
request to delist. Our IP address will automatically expire from listing after
some time.

UCEPROTECT Level 3 is the highest possible escalation: complete Autonomus
Systems (AS) get listed at Level 3 if there were too many impacts from IP's
listed in Level 1 originating from said AS within the last 7 days. OVH has
**4,197,632** IP addresses and **609** of these have been level 1 listed abusers
within the last 7 days.

I submitted `support request ticket 8121647
<https://www.ovh.com/manager/#/dedicated/support/tickets/8121647>`__ at OVH with
the following text:

  uceprotect.net recommends us to "send a complaint to your provider and request
  they fix this problem immediatly. Think about this: You pay them so that you
  can use the Internet without problems; if they are ignoring your complaint or
  claiming they can't do anything, you should consider changing your provider.
  There are currently about 105,000 providers worldwide, but only a few hundred
  make it to get listed into UCEPROTECT-Level 3."

OVH asked me to read `FAQ VPS OVHcloud
<https://help.ovhcloud.com/csm/en-gb-vps-faq?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0035158>`__
before submitting.

I was seriously considering to move away from OVH to another provider. But then
they answered to my support ticket. An exciting answer:

  Since January 2021, UCE Protect has placed our ASN (AS16276) on their
  blacklist like many others.

  You can see this by clicking on the following link:

  Our Trust and Safety legal abuse team is unable to contact UCE Protect to rectify the situation. Indeed, any attempt to communicate with them requires a paid subscription, which OVHcloud does not wish to take out.

  As a result, we have no idea why our ASN has been blacklisted.

  To date, we have found that no e-mail provider uses UCE Protect in their spam filters.

  If this affects you, we recommend the following:

  1. Prioritize an IPv6 configuration for sending e-mail, as UCE Protect does
  not blacklist e-mails sent via IPv6.  All our OVHcloud services come with at
  least one IPv6 address that you can configure. All major e-mail providers now
  support IPv6.

  Below you'll find documentation to help you configure your IPv6:
  https://help.ovhcloud.com/csm/fr-vps-configuring-ipv6?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0047576

  2. Ask the receiving party to contact their e-mail provider to stop using UCE Protect in their anti-spam filters.

  We invite you to consult the following guide for best practices in sending
  your e-mails: https://docs.ovh.com/fr/dedicated/optimiser-envoi-emails/

  OVHcloud is committed to an open and reliable Cloud. Thanks to the cooperation of users like you, we'll be able to continually improve our service in the future.
