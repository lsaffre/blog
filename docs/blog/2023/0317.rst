==============================
Cannot join existing household
==============================

Friday, March 17, 2023

Already quite some time we have several failures in the book doctests caused by
a difference in an Ajax action call. For example
:file:`docs/specs/households.rst`. The common thing was that one key in that Ajax
call, the `base_params`, had been removed. And I had no idea whether that was
good or bad.

Now I discovered ticket :ticket:`4905`, which shows that the test suite was
right: it had detected a regression. The problem is that we didn't care, and now
we will need more time to find back the cause. Sharif, do you remember to have
changed something in the inner code that might have caused this?

Meanwhile I had been working on a series of "minor" changes.
For example I changed the way we add intersphinx mappings to synodal docs.
And finally removed the dependency from rstgen to atelier

I now pushed them all
to their repositories because I am waiting for Sharif's feedback.
