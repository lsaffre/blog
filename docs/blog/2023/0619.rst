The changes for :ticket:`4551` will replace the "event pass" approach, which is
used in Lino Voga where we collect "events" in the volatile
:class:`InvoicingInfo` object. This approach will be replaced by a new journal
of "delivery notes". In Voga these delivery notes are internal: the customer
usually don't need them. Lino can generate them more or less automatically.

About the ProvisionFiller mixin.  A provision filler is an invoice generator
that creates invoices when a given provision has reached a given minimal
quantity. For example:

- Voga : the participant buys an entry pass for 10 sessions, and when 8 of these
  sessions have been used up, the customer receive an invoice in order to buy a
  next entry pass. This is called continuous enrolment.

- Noi : the customer buys a time credit of 5 hours, and when this credit is used
  up, they receive an invoice that invites them to buy new time credit.
