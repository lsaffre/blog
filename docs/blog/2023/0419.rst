We have a boolean field named "private" on three models: :term:`comment`,
:class:`lino_xl.lib.tickets.Ticket` and :class:`lino_xl.lib.tickets.Site`.

Actually this field should better be labelled "confidential".

The Publishable mixin should get a new method :meth:`is_public`, which would
return `False` by default.
For a blog entry it would return True or False depending on the state.
