I checked in my yesterday's work on :ticket:`1906`.

Then continued on :ticket:`1907` (Lino zeigt keine Konten an in EKR).
This is caused by the :meth:`get_allowed_accounts
<lino_xl.lib.ledger.Journal.get_allowed_accounts>` method. The only
problem is that no account had its
`lino_xl.lib.accounts.Account.purchase_allowed` checkbox checked.

The fundamental challenge is here: How to make these fields visible in
a flexible way?
