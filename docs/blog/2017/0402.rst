=====================

I did another series of small changes for Jane and Vilma.

courses.MyCourses : now ordered by *increasing* start_date.

It is now possible to filter courses by room (courses.Course.room)

When filtering sessions by organization, Lino Noi now shows all
sessions whose ticket has a wish in a milestone owned by that
organization (i.e. whose room points to that organization).

I added a StartSession action to deploy.Deployment (the with of a
milestone). I tidied up the API for defining these actions. Workable
now means anything that has a StartSession and an EndSession action. 

DeploymentsByTicket : clicking on a milestone now opens the milestone,
not the wish.

clocking.ServiceReport is now ContactRelated.
clocking.CoursesByReport replaces ProjectsByReport.  I am still
discovering how I can send a meaningfull overview about "what has been
done" to my customers.




I was working in Vilma and had clicked on a button which had caused
our well-known unreproductible Ajax error "ParameterStore of
LayoutHandle for X expects a list of Y values but got Z"
(:ticket:`358`).  But this time, instead of getting an alert box with
that message, my client remained in "Please wait..." eternally. Also a
:kbd:`Sh-Ctrl-R` did not bring it back to life.  Only 5 minutes later,
everything worked as if nothing had happened.  An in the Apache
error.log I see::

Hmm... what does this mean?

It seems that I can reproduce it by double-clicking on an event (m√µtetalgud 23.03.2017) in Vilma.
