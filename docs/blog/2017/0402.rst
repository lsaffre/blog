=====================

I did another series of small changes for Jane and Vilma.

courses.MyActivities : now ordered by *increasing* start_date.
Filter courses by room (courses.Course.room)

When filtering sessions by organization, Lino Noi now shows all
sessions whose ticket has a wish in a milestone owned by that
organization (i.e. whose room points to that organization).

I added a StartSession action to deploy.Deployment (the with of a
milestone). I tidied up the API for defining these actions. Workable
now means anything that has a StartSession and an EndSession action. 

DeploymentsByTicket : clicking on a milestone now opens the milestone,
not the wish.

clocking.CoursesByReport is now ContactRelated.
I am experimenting with this.
