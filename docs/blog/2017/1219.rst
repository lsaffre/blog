==========================

I upgraded :ref:`lf` which had become quite obsolete. This revealed
ticket :ticket:`2218`, yet another example of Py2to3 problems.  In
:mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.welfare` fixture I had::

   from builtins import str
   ...
   FUNCTIONS = Cycler(cv.Function.objects.all())
   ...
   def objects():
       f = FUNCTIONS.pop()
       ...
       yield jobs.Job(... name=str(f), ...)


The problem disappeared when I changed this to::

   import six
   ...
   FUNCTIONS = Cycler(cv.Function.objects.all())
   ...
   def objects():
       f = FUNCTIONS.pop()
       ...
       yield jobs.Job(... name=six.text_type(f), ...)



Ticket :ticket:`2220` was an easy customer request.
