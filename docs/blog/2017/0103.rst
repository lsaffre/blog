Online registration

The welcome mail to a new user must contain a link which should open
the dialog window of the Verify action. But Lino currently has no good
way for generating a permalink for this.

The tedious work of maintaining servers
=======================================

Oh, how I would love to have a system administrator! One who would
care about problems like the following one!

I had my inbox bombed every 30 seconds with the following message::

    Subject: Cron <root@vps>   [ -x /usr/lib/php5/sessionclean ] && /usr/lib/php5/sessionclean

    PHP Warning:  PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library '/usr/lib/php5/20131226/json.so' - /usr/lib/php5/20131226/json.so: undefined symbol:
    +json_c_version in Unknown on line 0

It started after our dist-upgrade on that server.
Yes, it seems that the PHP is broken::

    $ php5
    PHP Warning:  PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library '/usr/lib/php5/20131226/json.so' - /usr/lib/php5/20131226/json.so: undefined symbol: json_c_version in Unknown on line 0

I had the folllowing in :file:`/etc/cron.d/php5`::

    # Look for and purge old sessions every 30 minutes
    09,39 *     * * *     root   [ -x /usr/lib/php5/sessionclean ] && /usr/lib/php5/sessionclean

Actually I think that I once uninstalled PHP completely there.
Command to verify whether it is installed::

    $ apt list --installed | grep php
    php5-common/now 5.6.27+dfsg-0+deb8u1 amd64 [installed,upgradable to: 5.6.29+dfsg-0+deb8u1]
    php5-curl/now 5.6.27+dfsg-0+deb8u1 amd64 [installed,upgradable to: 5.6.29+dfsg-0+deb8u1]
    php5-gd/now 5.6.27+dfsg-0+deb8u1 amd64 [installed,upgradable to: 5.6.29+dfsg-0+deb8u1]
    php5-mysql/now 5.6.27+dfsg-0+deb8u1 amd64 [installed,upgradable to: 5.6.29+dfsg-0+deb8u1]

I removed these packages.

I am still having another series of warnings::

    dpkg: warning: files list file for package 'libffi5:amd64' missing; assuming package has no files currently installed
    dpkg: warning: files list file for package 'libopenjpeg2:amd64' missing; assuming package has no files currently installed
    dpkg: warning: files list file for package 'gcc-4.4-base:amd64' missing; assuming package has no files currently installed

    dpkg: warning: files list file for package 'libjpeg8:amd64' missing; assuming package has no files currently installed

When I try to reinstall them, I get::

    $ sudo apt-get install --reinstall libffi5
    Reading package lists... Done
    Building dependency tree
    Reading state information... Done
    Reinstallation of libffi5 is not possible, it cannot be downloaded.
    0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 23 not upgraded.
    (demo)luc@vps:~$

A quick surf revealed that they are probably just obsolete packages,
so I removed them as well::

    $ sudo apt-get remove ... libdb5.1 libtiff4 librtmp0 libjpeg8
    Reading package lists... Done
    Building dependency tree
    Reading state information... Done
    The following package was automatically installed and is no longer required:
      liblcms1
    Use 'apt-get autoremove' to remove it.
    The following packages will be REMOVED:
      libdb5.1 libgd2-xpm libgvc5 libjpeg8 libmagickcore5 libmagickcore5-extra libmagickwand5 libpython2.6 librtmp0 libtiff4 openjdk-6-jre
      openjdk-6-jre-headless openjdk-6-jre-lib python2.6 python2.6-dev
    0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 15 to remove and 23 not upgraded.
    After this operation, 92.7 MB disk space will be freed.
    Do you want to continue? [Y/n]

I then stopped at 6:05 after rebooting the server.  At 10:28 I noticed
that the server still hadn't restarted.  :ref:`andi` got it up and
running again. He said that `systemd
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd>`__ was the guilty and that I
am `not the first one to get disturbed
<http://imgur.com/gallery/D1XK8nk>`__ by this.

Oh, how I would love to have a `system administrator
<https://www.saffre-rumma.net/jobs/admin/>`_! One who would care about
problems like this!


:ref:`noi` now requires `rest_framework`
========================================

:ref:`grigorij` reported that :ref:`noi` now (after
:blogref:`20161229`) needs `rest_framework
<http://www.django-rest-framework.org/>`__. I added it to the
project's :term:`install_requires`: `acd718b <https://github.com/lino-framework/noi/commit/f67097c5b3dd8bdee6c0bc579b33851e1acd718b>`__ remove usage of restframework


It's of course a shame that newbies must stumble over such
problems. Actually we have :ref:`travis` for this.  But :ref:`travis`
is currently kind of disabled because it is failing all the time, I
simply ignore these failures. This in turn is because most of these
problems are "just" some environment problem which does not occur on a
production site, and because it takes time to fix them, and (last but
not least) because I believe that this is a good job for a volunteer.
I dare to hope that we will soon find a volunteer who cares about
"quality control":

As a *Lino Quality Supervisor* you are going to watch the builds done
by our :ref:`travis` account and try to fix them when appropriate.
You learn a lot about Python in general, continuous integration and
the development workflow of an open source project. You will have
write access to the Lino repositories, so this responsibility requires
a certain experience.
