===================

I had an interesting article in my inbox and though that I would
quickly note this in my internal blog in :ref:`amici`.  Basically it
worked, but it caused a little chain reaction.

- I opened :ticket:`1819` (Handling blog entries copied from Internet)
  and worked on it.  Blog entries are now bleached. And then how to
  display them in the dashboard.
  
  I boldy changed the behaviour of
  :func:`lino.utils.soup.truncate_comment`: truncate_comment now never
  returns more than one paragraph.  I am not sure whether this is what
  we really want, but let's observe it.
  
- While I was there I did :ticket:`1650` (Multiple topics per ticket).
  This required :ticket:`1822`
  (New feature : Writable virtual foreignkey fields)

I checked in my work though some tests are still failing.
