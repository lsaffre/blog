========================

I discovered some files in :ref:`xl` whose header was by mistake still
saying that they are published using the GPL. XL is BSD.  And I also
changed :ref:`cosi` from AGPL to BSD because (as far as I meanwhile
believe to know), I may publish my work under BSD even when it derived
from a work published under AGPL. The only questionable item is file
:file:`camt.py` in :mod:`lino_cosi.lib.b2c`.

I had to "wipe" the builds on 
https://readthedocs.org/projects/lino/versions/
