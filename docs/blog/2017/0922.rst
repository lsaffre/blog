No file to run: 'python'
========================

Released atelier 1.0.9 : Several tasks in :mod:`atelier.invlib` used
to call hard-coded `python`, but on certain CI environments the Python
executable has another name. Replaced by `sys.executable`.

It seems that they upgraded something on :ref:`travis` because that's
where it happened:
https://travis-ci.org/lino-framework/book/jobs/278421414



Comboboxes show only the first page of choices (extjs3)
=======================================================

Aur√©lie reported :ticket:`2079`.

I guess that the bug is in
:func:`lino.modlib.extjs.views.choices_response`,
and Tonis's commit 
37b2d0e9ee9117ddc81edf6df2c1ad5d394c9e2f
(for #2006 Fix quickfilter for simple choices filters)
might be to blame. But I did not yet understand.
