No file to run: 'python'
========================

Released atelier 1.0.9 : Several tasks in :mod:`atelier.invlib` used
to call hard-coded `python`, but on certain CI environments the Python
executable has another name. Replaced by `sys.executable`.

It seems that they upgraded something on :ref:`travis` because that's
where it happened:
