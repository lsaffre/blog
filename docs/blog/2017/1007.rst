VAT Areas
=========

A few seemingly innocent test suite failures after :ticket:`2099`
triggered an avalanche of changes which I summarize as a new
:ticket:`2100` (VAT Areas).

- VAT rules now work per "VAT area"
  (:class:`lino_xl.lib.vat.VatAreas`), no longer per country.

- Partners in the demo databases now have more "correct" VAT regimes,
  i.e. which correspond to their country.

For example :mod:`lino_xl.lib.invoicing.fixtures.demo_bookings` was
failing in :ref:`voga` because there was one enrolment for Alfons
whose invoice_recipient points to Erna, a second enrolment for Erna
directly. The first enrolment returned Erna as *Partner*, the second
returned her as *Pupil*. So Lino did not group them and generated two
different items in the plan. Later when executing the plan, the first
item made an invoice for both enrolments, and then on the second
item's :meth:`create_invoice` Lino complained that "No invoiceables
found for %s.".


Miscellaneous
=============

The default value for
:attr:`lino.modlib.extjs.Plugin.autorefresh_seconds` is now 0.  Also
in :ref:`extjs6`.
