This weekend I worked 9 hours on how to make the SQL for
AccountingReport more efficient.

- :mod:`atelier.rstgen` had a problem for rendering the `empty_column`
  columns. Fixed (but just a hack, to be reviewed).

- The :xfile:`restore.py` file created by :manage:`dump2py` now calls
  :manage:`resetsequences` after loading the dump. Because it doesn't
  take much time, and because forgetting it can cause frustration.

- Fixed the Gateway timeout problem in
  :class:`lino_xl.lib.ledger.AccountingReport` by optimizing the SQL
  query.
