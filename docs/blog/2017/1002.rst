This weekend I worked 9 hours on how to make the SQL for
AccountingReport more efficient.
It was about 
`Using aggregates within a Subquery expression
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref/models/expressions/#using-aggregates-within-a-subquery-expression>`__.
Now finally I can check in. Here is a
summary of the changes:

- Fixed the Gateway timeout problem in
  :class:`lino_xl.lib.accounting.AccountingReport` by optimizing the SQL
  query.
  
- The :xfile:`restore.py` file created by :cmd:`pm dump2py` now calls
  :manage:`resetsequences` after loading the dump. Because it doesn't
  take much time, and because forgetting it can cause frustration.

- :mod:`atelier.rstgen` had a problem for rendering the `empty_column`
  columns. Fixed (but just a hack, to be reviewed).


I continued to hunt some failures under Python 3  

- TypeError: Problem installing fixture '...demo_bookings.py':
  argument must of text type (`282196028
  <https://travis-ci.org/lino-framework/book/jobs/282196028>`__)
