========================

I have some failures `on travis
<https://travis-ci.org/lino-framework/book/builds/309959114>`_ which
don't occur on my machine.  In order to try to reproduce them, I
reinstalled the default Lino environment on my machine using the
:xfile:`install_dev_projects.sh`. I can now confirm that this file
still more testing.  Afterwards I had a failure in the
:ref:`dev.models` tutorial because I accidentally had installed the
repositories into another directory.





A failure â€‹:message:`django.core.exceptions.ValidationError: {'iban':
[u'CR IBANs must contain 22 characters.']}` was caused by fictive demo
data in file :file:`COD_20150907_O25MMF107I.xml` in
:mod:`lino_cosi.lib.b2c.fixtures`.  The file contained IBAN from CR
(Costa Rica), and it seems that either CR has changed their format
recently, or django-localflavor has recently started to verify them.

I replaced them by account numbers from MK

other fictive

<IBAN>CR
<IBAN>HR
