Yet another release to jane and vilma
with a few optimizations:
:ticket:`1660` (Cannot specify an end_user)
:ticket:`1659` (Display ticket's status together with summary)

:ticket:`1661` (Sarkastische Fehlermeldung "Herzlichen Gl√ºckwunsch")
is for Monique and Gaby. (Monique told me how Gaby had been working
alone with Lino for the first time, and that was unfortunately exactly
while I was working on another site on that server. At some moment she
received a "Congratulations, you found an error in our system."

In I changed the text "Congratulations, you found an error in our
system."  to "Oops, you found an error in our system.  Don't panic,
this is definitively not your fault. (...)", including a reference to
the :attr:`lino.core.site.Site.hoster_status_page`.
