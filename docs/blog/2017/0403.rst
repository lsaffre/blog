Yet another release to jane and vilma
with a few optimizations:
:ticket:`1660` (Cannot specify an end_user),
:ticket:`1659` (Display ticket's status together with summary),
:ticket:`1662` (Some fields are missing in SiteConfig detail layout).

A less internal ticket is :ticket:`1661` (Sarkastische Fehlermeldung
"Herzlichen Gl√ºckwunsch"). This is because Monique told me how Gaby
had been working alone with Lino for the first time, and that was
unfortunately exactly when I was working on another site on that
server. At some moment she received a "Congratulations, you found an
error in our system."

In :xfile:`500.html` I changed the text "Congratulations, you found an
error in our system."  to "Oops, you found an error in our system.
Don't panic, this is definitively not your fault. (...)", including a
reference to the new site attribute :attr:`hoster_status_page
<lino.core.site.Site.hoster_status_page>`.
