=====================


The test suite in :mod:`lino_welfare.projects.std` was still failing
(in the :mod:`test_debts` case) because
:class:`lino.mixins.duplicable.Duplicate` now asks for a confirmation
(:ticket:`1716`). Testing such a dialog was rather complicated until
now. But I had done it at least once, namely in the :mod:`test_beid`
case of that same test suite. Now I generalized that code into a new
utility method :meth:`TestCase.check_callback_dialog
<lino.utils.djangotest.DjangoManageTestCase.check_callback_dialog>`.

And `test_notify` of the same suite was failing because Lino now
checks permissions for every action request. This is a confirmation
that my yesterday's changes are into the right direction. For example
Lino executed state change actions like `mark_former` or
`mark_refused` without verifying whether that action was permitted.

I propagated the changes in :xfile:`linoweb.js` to :ref:`extjs6`.

TODO:

- There is a second dialog in `test_beid` which can be converted
  to :meth:`check_callback_dialog`.
  And another one in `test_notify` of the same suite.
