Hamza and I had a field visit for the ext3to6 project. We temporarily
switched Jane to ExtJS6 and then tested whether it is usable. Result:
it is *almost* usable. Hamza wrote down the details (I delegated that
task to him :-).

I realized that the approach using `design_name` is *not* yet what we
need, and wrote (with Hamza watching) a sponaneous new approach using
a :attr:`mobile_view` Site attribute.

TODO:

- Configure a new subdomain m.site.example.com for Jane which inherits
  from the main jane, similar to what bugs does. But unlike bugs it
  changes the `mobile_view` attribute instead of the `default_ui` and
  `default_user` attributes.
  
- Figure out how to automatically have clients choose between the
  "desktop" version and the "mobile version.
- start writing mobile-friendly layouts (see untested example in
  :mod:`lino.modlib.users`)
- write more documentation
