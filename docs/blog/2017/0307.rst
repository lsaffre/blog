About projects and tickets
==========================

More ideas about :ticket:`1516`. The difference between "ticket" and
"project" is indeed difficult to explain.  For example something that
started as a seemingly meaningless "ticket" can grow into a whole
"project". But that's not the point.  The most visible difference is
that projects have a *name* while tickets just have a *number*.
Another rule of thumb is that tickets should be atomic tasks.


I realized that a project in Noi is called a *product backlog item*
(PBI) or a *Sprint* in Scrum. Or at least for the moment I don't see
why Lino should introduce a new database model for differentiating
them. We have the ProjectType
  
As a result, I updated the :ref:`noi.specs.projects` documentation
page.


I worked on :ticket:`1551` and :ticket:`1553`.  I could not reproduce
:ticket:`1551`. We will look at it after the release.  But I defined
now a :meth:`set_author` method which is called after duplicating.

I fixed :ticket:`1553` by a minor change in
:class:`lino_xl.lib.cal.mixins.EventGenerator`

Minor optimization: When testing manually, I saw that
:class:`ContractPartner
<lino_welfare.modlib.isip.models.ContractPartner>` should have
:attr:`allow_cascaded_delete` set to ``['contract']``.
