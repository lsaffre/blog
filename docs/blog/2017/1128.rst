Exporting contacts as vcard files
=================================

I added a new action :class:`ExportVCardFile
<lino_xl.lib.contacts.ExportVCardFile>` which exists now on every list
of partners (if your application has :attr:`use_vcard_export
<lino_xl.lib.contacts.Plugin.use_vcard_export>` set to `True`, which
is used e.g. in :ref:`amici` or in :mod:`lino_book.projects.min2`).

vCard and icalendar files use the same syntax, and fortunately we have
`vobject <http://eventable.github.io/vobject/>`__ which simplifies
things greatly.

The feature seems not very useful as long as contact clients have no
feature for deleting duplicate entries. In Evolution this seems to be
at least tricky, you need to manually download and install the correct
debian file of a plugin.
