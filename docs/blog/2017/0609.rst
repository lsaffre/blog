Night session : I got the book docs to build again after yesterday's
changes for :ticket:`1329`.

Then I started to restore the test suites.  Since this is a
frustrating and long-lasting work and with rather little educational
value, Tonis and I decided to *not* meet today.  Tonis will review the
content of the :ref:`lino.dev` rather than wathing me fix the test
suite.


As a side effect : :func:`atelier.utils.rmu` which deprecates
:func:`atelier.utils.tuple_py2` & Co. Example:

>>> from atelier.utils import rmu
>>> lst = [123, "123", u"Äöü"]
>>> rmu(lst)
[123, '123', '\xc4\xf6\xfc']
>>> rmu(tuple(lst))
(123, '123', '\xc4\xf6\xfc')
>>> dct = {i: i for i in lst}
>>> rmu(dct)
{123: 123, '\xc4\xf6\xfc': '\xc4\xf6\xfc', '123': '123'}
