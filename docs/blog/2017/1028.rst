==========================

I renamed :mod:`lino.modlib.plausibility` to
:mod:`lino.modlib.checkdata` (:ticket:`2131`).

And then continued to fiddle in the :ref:`lino.dev`.

And then I did yet another work one does only when you have no better
ideas: I merged the docs and the tests of :ref:`voga` into the book.
I had at least one confirmation that this was a good thing: it made me
discover that the specs of voga hadn't been tested for several weeks.

I had no better ideas because today I also had to prepare my luggages.
On Monday when I will go to Belgium for 2 weeks.
