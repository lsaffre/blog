Miscellaneous
=============

Yesterday, when reproducing that UnicodeException, I also changed an
API detail in the :attr:`on_ui_updated
<lino.core.signals.on_ui_updated>` signals: the `request` is now an
ActionRequest (and no longer a HttpRequest).

And with this I discovered (in
:mod:`lino_welfare.projects.chatelet.modlib.pcsw.models`) an old and
forgotten :attr:`on_ui_updated <lino.core.signals.on_ui_updated>`
handler which was sending an email each time somebody modified a
:class:`notes.Note`. I removed that handler.

And today I saw :ticket:`1475`, which is exactly the problem which
matches this change.

To replace that handler, I now changed :mod:`lino_xl.lib.notes` so
that a Note is now also a :class:`ChangeObservable
<lino.modlib.notify.mixins.ChangeObservable>` who sends notifications
to the client's coaches.

I adapted the test suites after our yesterday's changes.

I continued to work with Tonis on the RecentComments list. It is not
yet what I would call an elegant API, but the result looks satisfying
for the moment.
