Renamed "auth" plugin back to "users"
=====================================

Yes yesterday I realized that actually we didn't need to rename
"users" to "auth". And yes, there is no technical need to turn back
now, but

- lino.modlib.users is about *users*, not about *authentication*.
- it is less work to go back *now* than e.g. in two years.
- We are only *almost* there, e.g. some users.rst files in the specs
  haven't yet been renamed.
- The community effect : it is easier to explain to Tonis why I
  decided to go back than to all other developers why we renamed it
  from users to auth.

So I now did what was obvious. I prefer working three hours and being
back at the same place as before over working only two hours and being
at the wrong place.

I created a separate ticket :ticket:`1897` for this.

  

Lino and the Django PR
======================

Yesterday I was disappointed when I saw that Tim Graham closed my PR
one hour later with the lapidar comment "This change doesn't qualify
for a backport to 1.11 per our `supported versions policy
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/release-process/#supported-versions>`__."
The fact that he then closed the PR tells me that they don't even want
to discuss about it.  But then he also answered in Django ticket
`#28302 <https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/28302>`__, and this
sheds new light onto the thing: I "just" need to

- rewrite my PR against master
- add tests and documentation  

But this is less urgent since there is (as it seems) no way of getting
it into Django 1.x because of their "supported versions policy".

In the long run they are even right: they refuse to do useless work
and force us to move forward (to Python 3). Why not.  Yes, that's both
the advantage and drawback of having a big community.

I moved three modules (backends, middleware and utils) from
:mod:`lino.modlib.users` to :mod:`lino.core.auth` because that's where
they should go.

I reviewed the documentation pages about all this (it is not
finished but it is getting clear at least to me):

- :ref:`about.auth`
- :ref:`dev.users`  
- :ref:`specs.users`
- :ref:`dev.permissions`

This is work on :ticket:`1329`.


Documentation
=============

I am reviewing the general structure of the Lino Book:

- about : non-technical stuff for stakeholders

- dev : for developers (newbies and experienced, core and application)

- admin : for system administrators who want to install and run some
  Lino application (and keep it alive, and possibly do all this with
  many applications)

- hosting : a separate section for the "Hosting programme"

- community : a separate section for the "Community" (whatever this
  means...)

As a result I moved two pages from hosting to admin because they were
obviously too technical.
