In the :xfile:`presence_sheet.weasy.html` we had::

  {{guest.state.button_text}}

which didn't show anything in :ref:`welfare` because unlike
:ref:`avanti` they use :mod:`lino_xl.lib.cal` plugin with the
:mod:`feedback <lino_xl.lib.cal.workflows.feedback>` workflow which
unlike :mod:`voga <lino_xl.lib.cal.workflows.voga>` uses icons instead
of button texts. Solution::

  {{guest.state.button_text or guest.state}}
