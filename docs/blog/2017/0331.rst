I did the code changes for :ticket:`1546` (Use courses.Course as
milestone_model).

I removed the models deploy.Milestone and tickets.Site.  Existing
deploy.Milestone objects must be migrated to courses.Course, existing
tickets.Site to cal.Room

I also removed tickets.Comptence (existing rows can be thrown away).



    TypeError: unorderable types: str() and <type 'str'>
