Skype for Linux wants to update, but Ubuntu Software Updater says
"This requires installing packages from unauthenticated sources." and
the details say:

| Changes for skypeforlinux versions:
| Installed version: 5.3.0.1
| Available version: 5.4.0.1
| This update does not come from a source that supports changelogs.

https://askubuntu.com/questions/578292/software-update-this-requires-installing-packages-from-unauthenticated-sources

I "fixed" this as follows::

    $ sudo apt remove skypeforlinux
    $ sudo apt install skypeforlinux
    [sudo] password for luc:

New tasks for Tera
==================

- Übersetzung von "Entry date" muss sein "Eingabedatum", nicht
  "Buchungsdatum"
  
- MWSt-Erklärung zeigt überall 0. Muss sie aufs Belegdatum schauen
  oder aufs Eingabedatum?  --> Weder noch; sie muss auf die
  Buchungsperiode schauen.

- The display text of a countries.Place is currently "Eupen (None)"
  which is stupid.

- tim2lino must import `PAR->Name2` as well. for example Partner
  0150430 (ÖSHZ Eupen) has lots of others which iffer only by that
  field.
  
- how to use tim2lino for importing master data without loosing
  invoices.

- payment_terms only per partner, not per voucher. No need to have
  them per invoice since they serve only for computing a default value
  of due_date.
