Yet another series of quick changes in Noi. Both Jane and Vilma
currently use the same application (Lino Noi). In Jane we now also
have courses although in Jane we probably won't need them. I want to
keep Jane and Vilma under the same applicatoin as long as possible. It
amazing to see that you can use the same application for managing
software forges and villages.

New user role :class:`lino_xl.lib.cal.roles.CalendarReader` and table
:class:`lino_xl.lib.cal.PublicEvents`. My plan here is to make it
possible to show calendar events to anonymous users. Not finished.
