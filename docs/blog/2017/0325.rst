========================

Yesterday I didn't work because we had a family day, my gift for
Iiris' birthday. Except from 16 to 20 I where I had promised to attend
to a local event.

This event was a training for village activists about teamwork.  I am
not a very active village activist, but Lino Vilma is meant to be used
by such people.  So I could not avoid to promise them that today I
will do a quick demonstration of Lino Noi for the :ref:`vilma`
project.

Probably triggered by this, but based on ideas which had been there
before, I had a nightly inspiration and did a series of quick changes
in noi and xl:

- deploy.Milestone now inherits from UserAuthored and DatePeriod. New
  table `My milestones` which is even a dashboard item. In Jane, Hamza
  and Tonis will get their milestone : For Hamza this will be "Next
  demo of Jane with ExtJS 6 to Luc", for Tonis "Next demo of Jane with
  mailbox to Luc".
  
- Activated the calendar module. New plugin :mod:`lino_noi.lib.cal`.
  Changed :attr:`lino_noi.projects.team.settings.Site.project_model`
  from `ticklets.Project` to `tickets.Milestone`.

And then I released these changes to the vilma demo site and entered
some demo data. Works like a charm! 

TODO:

- the meanings and relations of sites and rooms is not yet clear.
- release to Jane as well and start using milestones
- adapt the test suite after these changes.
