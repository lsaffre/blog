Merike twittered a nice observation:

    Yes, English can be weird. It can be understood through tough
    thorough thought, though.

I started to work on :ticket:`1626` by trying it with :ref:`noi`: I
moved all the demo projects and all the documents that rely on them
(i.e. basically all the specs) from noi to the book repository.  Why
am I doing this?  See :doc:`0323`.

Yes, the Book becomes much bigger, and the applications themselves
become very thin.  I continue to not be very *sure* but to have the
*feeling* and that this is the right direction. The ticket is a bit
urgent because it is probably one of the causes for our problems on
Travis.

Side effect:

- I stumbled over :ticket:`1642`. Comments are no longer public.
- I changed the `__repr__` of :class:`lino.core.actions.Action`
