Avanti optimizations
====================

I worked on :ticket:`2169` for which I created two subtickets:

- :ticket:`2171` was easy, just an additional chunk of html in the slave
  summary.
  
- :ticket:`2172` was only a few lines of code changes, but took me a
  couple of hours because these things are quite subtle. I added a
  test case in :mod:`lino_book.projects.roger.tests.test_faggio`.


- The views in :mod:`lino_xl.lib.cal` which until now required
  `(OfficeUser, OfficeOperator)` require now the new user role
  :class:`lino_xl.lib.cal.GuestOperator`.
         
       

Inner beauty
============

I deactivated the Python 3 line in the :xfile:`.travis.yml` files of
:ref:`book` and :ref:`xl`. Because I know that the test suites are
still currently failing under Python 3 (I still hope that Gaetan will
release `appy-python-3
<https://forge.pallavi.be/projects/appy-python-3>`__ in the near
future) and there is no need to let :ref:`travis` test it again and
again.


I opened :ticket:`2173` (ConnectionError when book test suite runs
without internet). It occurs in :ref:`specs.noi.github`. One hour
later Tonis had fixed it :-)
