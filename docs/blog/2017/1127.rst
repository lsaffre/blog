I made local tests and code changes for :ticket:`2162` and then
deployed :ref:`tera` to their production site.

En passant I fixed 8 trivial failures in welfare.

There is a chance that some therapies (courses.Course) have been lost
with the initial data import : those whose `PAR->IdPar2` was the same
as `PAR->IdPar`.
