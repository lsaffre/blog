Today I had two hangouts with Steve, teaching him how to edit the
template for an :class:`isip.Contract`. He likes it.

Some last changes (a translation and a field in column_names) which I
will release tonight.

A last aftermath of :ticket:`1857` is that :cmd:`inv bd` failed in
:ref:`welfare`.  It happened in a :rst:dir:`django2rst` with a complex
piece of code in :ref:`welfare.excerpts.examples.de` I moved that code
from the rst document to a new module
:mod:`lino_xl.lib.excerpts.doctools`.

I changed the :attr:`default_build_method
<lino.core.site.Site.default_build_method>` in
:mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.welfare.settings` from 'appyodt' to
'appypdf' because above list of examples is not very useful if the
documents are odt files. They were odt files because in the beginning
I was not running :ref:`admin.oood` on my development machine as a
service, which caused the test suite and :cmd:`inv bd` to fail when I
had forgotten to manually start oood before launching them.
