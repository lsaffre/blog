Sphinx typographical quotes cause test failures
===============================================

:ticket:`1889` came because Sphinx 1.6.1 had started to write smart
quotes into the `help_text` texts. And these help texts are displayed
in specs like e.g. :ref:`book.specs.cal` (by :func:`show_fields
<lino.api.doctests.show_fields>`).

I had changed these specs (which was a quite stupid work), but
recently I downgraded my Sphinx to 1.5.x because the newest version
has `an issue <https://github.com/abakan/ablog/issues/88>`__.

Now I read `here <https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/3824>`__
that these smart quotes were actually always deactivated by default in
Sphinx, and their appearance was a "bug" introduced because docutils
changed the way how to deactivate them.

I added a file :xfile:`docutils.conf` for :Ref:`book`.

I continued to adapt the tests in book after :ticket:`1329`.
