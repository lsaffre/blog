release@avanti
==============

I released :ref:`avanti` to their production site.  Session log::
  
    $ ./make_snapshot.sh
    $ ./pull.sh
    $ a
    $ pip install -U django
    $ python manage.py run snapshot/restore.py

There were two manual changes to do in the :xfile:`restore.py` file::

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
      File "snapshot/restore.py", line 470, in create_lists_listtype
    TypeError: 'name_en' is an invalid keyword argument for this function

Actually this was a double change: for lists.List and for
lists.ListType.

And then the rename of :attr:`User.profile` into :attr:`User.user_type
<lino.modlib.users.User.user_type>`::

    def create_users_user(...):
        ...
        kw.update(user_type=profile)
        ...


About MTI
=========

I fixed :ticket:`1926` (BabelFields on MTI parent fail to
dump/restore), converted the mti and nomti projects from tutorial to
:mod:`lino_book.projects` and started to gather documentation about
MTI under :ref:`dev.mti`.
