Merge `Site.actors` into `Site.models`
======================================

I cleaned up an odd thing in Lino. Until now we had two
:class:`AttrDict <atelier.utils.AttrDict>` objects on the Site
instance: :attr:`actors <lino.core.site.Site.actors>` and
:attr:`models <lino.core.site.Site.models>`. The difference between
them was rather difficult to explain.  And while working on
:ticket:`1933` after I had converted the :file:`ui.py` of
:mod:`lino_xl.lib.vat` to :file:`desktop.py` I stumbled over an error
:message:`vat.VatRegimes is not a class` which was caused by this.

Now we have only :attr:`models <lino.core.site.Site.models>`, an
:class:`AttrDict <atelier.utils.AttrDict>` which maps the `app_label`
of every installed plugin to its :xfile:`models.py` module (augmented
by the layout module (usualle :xfile:`desktop.py`) as explained under
:attr:`layout_name <lino.core.site.Site.layout_name>`.


Luc now on mastodon
===================

I opened an account on Mastodon: lsaffre@mastodon.network

`Mastodon <https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon>`__ is a free,
open-source social network. A decentralized alternative to commercial
platforms, it avoids the risks of a single company monopolizing your
communication. Pick a server that you trust â€” whichever you choose,
you can interact with everyone else. Anyone can run their own Mastodon
instance and participate in the social network seamlessly.
