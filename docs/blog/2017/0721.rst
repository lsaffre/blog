I committed a few changes to my picsel project:

- :file:`digikam2blog.py` sorted the pictures by their modification
  time which is not useful for writing the list fto the `index.rst`
  file. We now sort them by their filename.

- I reviewed the README file  

- I saw that the code of the picsel project was still under its old
  name `shotwell2blog` on github and renamed that repo to `picsel
  <https://github.com/lsaffre/picsel>`__. My apologies for possibly
  broken links.

Importing from TIM to Lino Tera
===============================
  
I continued to work for :ticket:`1874`. This is a complex ticket
because it includes designing a first proposal for the therapeutic
functionality of TIM.  I started a document for thinking about these
things (in German): :ref:`tera.specs.tim2lino`.
