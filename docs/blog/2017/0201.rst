======================================

I worked several hours on an avalanche of small optimizations. The
avalanche was caused by :ticket:`1445` (a ticket which I created only
now, it is the idea of having multiple roles per user type, which I
started for :ticket:`1400`. I now basically revoked that idea and went
back to where I was before (every user *type* has one and only user
*role*), except that things have become more clear (or at least I hope
so).

I had to convert the :ref:`dev.watch` tutorial from old to new format.

I also updated :ref:`lino.tutorial.polls`.
