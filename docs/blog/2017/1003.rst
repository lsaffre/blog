Ring
====

I installed Ring.

https://ring.cx/en/download/gnu-linux

They ask me to do::

    sudo sh -c "echo 'deb https://dl.ring.cx/ring-nightly/ubuntu_16.04/ ring main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ring-nightly-main.list"
    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys A295D773307D25A33AE72F2F64CD5FA175348F84
    sudo add-apt-repository universe
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ring


I did only the first and the last line because

- `apt-key adv --recv-keys` should not be used without care because
  there are no checks performed, so it is easy to undermine the
  apt-secure(8) infrastructure.

- The third line is not necessary for since I already have this option
  checked:

    .. image:: universe.png

It worked without giving them full trust::
  
    $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ring           
    The following additional packages will be installed:
      libdbus-c++-1-0v5 libjsoncpp1 ring-daemon
    The following NEW packages will be installed:
      libdbus-c++-1-0v5 libjsoncpp1 ring ring-daemon

Here is my new ring account (my old account is probably no longer
usable because I did that on my old smartphone and I didn't want to
find it back and try reconnect from there):

Accounts balance
================

While explaining the :class:`lino_xl.lib.ledger.AccountBalances` to
Tonis, I realized another bug: :ticket:`2090`. I fixed this.

En passant I also reviewed the specs section about
:ref:`specs.tera.sql.AccountingReport` where the output of
:func:`show_sql_queries <lino.api.doctest.show_sql_queries>` was
truncated too much.

The :func:`show_sql_queries <lino.api.doctest.show_sql_queries>`
function now removes all apostrophes (``"``) from the output. This
helps a lot to make things more readable.



Reminders in Avanti
===================

I finally found time to start working on :ticket:`2083`.

The most important item is:

- Tabelle mit Abmahnungen. NB Abmahnung wird ausgedruckt auf Papier
  und per Post verschickt.


.. currentmodule:: lino_avanti.lib.courses

In :mod:`lino_avanti.lib.courses` I added a new model
:class:`Reminder`.

The :class:`ReminderByClient` table inspired me to add a little new
internal feature: :ref:`remote_master` (:ticket:`2092`).
