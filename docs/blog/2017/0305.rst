=====================

There were still some problems with the test suites after for
:ticket:`1492`.  The default value for :attr:`hide_events_before` is
being set in :mod:`lino_xl.lib.cal.fixtures.std`.

I deployed the new version to the Avanti production site. Optimized
the demo data for our next site visit. Discovered and fixed a
UnicodeError.

The *task states* (:class:`lino_xl.lib.cal.workflows.TaskStates`) now
use unicode symbols when :attr:`use_silk_icons` is set to False (and
for :ref:`avanti` this is the case). The recommended icon strategy is
to use unicode symbols (`button_text`) instead of icons (`icon_name`).
At least for actions that are being displayed in workflow buttons. For
toolbar buttons the unicode symbols are admittedly not yet optimal. A
clear advantage of silk icons is currently that they are
colored. Though that advantage may become void if we add a way of
specifying the colors (background and foreground) for the
`button_text`.
