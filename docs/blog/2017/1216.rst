Oh my God, after :doc:`reappearing on Facebook <1215>` yesterday I
couldn't refrain from confirming dozens of friend suggestions and
copying my blog post to my Facebook wall.  And of course my friends
reacted.  One of them asked "What caused the change of mind concerning
Google, my dear?"

Dear Duche, I didn't change my mind concerning Google and Facebook.  I
changed my answer to the question whether it makes sense to boycott
one of them.  And I am already regretting it.  My comeback makes me
realize more clearly why I had left them :ref:`two years ago
<quit_facebook>`.  Being on FB leads you to continuous temptation. Of
course I *love* to talk with my friends about all kinds of topics. Of
course I *would* love to simply take part into these discussions
without caring about who then gains property of our collective
intellectual work.  Should I stop worrying about these questions?  I
thought that I should but it seems that I can't.  Without these
questions I wouldn't work on :ref:`amici` and on
:ref:`lino.socialauth`. Should I really stop working on these
projects?  I feel like the bull in Francis Cabrel's `La Corrida
