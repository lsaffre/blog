I wrote a new job offer for a `marketing assistant
<http://www.saffre-rumma.net/jobs/ma/>`__ and reviewed our general
`Jobs <http://www.saffre-rumma.net/jobs>`__ page.

I read Erik Marsja's `PyCharm vs Spyder: a quick comparsion of two
Python IDEs
<http://www.marsja.se/pycharm-vs-spyder-comparing-ides/>`__, and
because Spyder uses PyQt, I started to dream once more about a Lino
client in PyQt. I read `PyQt - Introduction
<https://www.tutorialspoint.com/pyqt/pyqt_introduction.htm>`__.

Seems that PyQt5 is best for me. Let's try::

    $ sudo apt-get install pyqt5-dev-tools
    $ p3 # activate my Python 3 environment
    $ pip install qtpy
    $ pip install pyqt5

Here is my first Qt snippet (copied from `here
<https://www.tutorialspoint.com/pyqt/pyqt_hello_world.htm>`_):

.. literalinclude:: 1.py

I had an :message:`AttributeError: module 'qtpy.QtGui' has no
attribute 'QApplication'`, that's because the modularization has been
changed as explained in `Transition from Qt 4.x to Qt5
<https://wiki.qt.io/Transition_from_Qt_4.x_to_Qt5>`__.

Tutorialspoint unfortunately now continues using QtDesigner, that's
not what I want.  But `this one <http://zetcode.com/gui/pyqt5/>`__ is
a better one tutorial for me. Here is my sandbox code after reaching
their `layouts section <http://zetcode.com/gui/pyqt5/layout/>`__


.. literalinclude:: 2.py

  
My summary after my first session: nice! promising!

An important thing to try out is how to display and edit tabular data
(probably using `QTableWidget
<http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtablewidget.html>`_).  Another important
question is whether it can run on mobile devices (probably using
`pyqtdeploy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyqtdeploy/1.3.1>`_).
