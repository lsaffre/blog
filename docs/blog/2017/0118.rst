Rumma & Ko as Lino hosting provider
===================================

Today's big news is that Rumma & Ko plans to become themselves a
:ref:`Lino hosting provider <hosting_provider>`.  Yesterday I had a 4
hours meeting with :ref:`tanel` and :ref:`tonis` in Tallinn where we
started a business plan and a first draft for the SLA we are going to
offer to our customers.

The mere *idea* of doing it myself came to my mind only shortly before
the meeting, at around 15:30, during my travel to Tallinn with Tanel.
Before that moment I was convinced that Rumma & Ko would always remain
a developer and never enter the hosting business.

The plan is yet to be confirmed, we are working on it
(:ticket:`1395`).  I will consult with our partners. Tanel will
prepare internal documents.  Tonis must first decide whether he joins
the `team <https://www.saffre-rumma.net/team/>`_ or not.
