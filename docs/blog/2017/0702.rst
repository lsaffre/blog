====================

I did a few more changes after exploring the results of the test runs:
:attr:`country_module
<lino_xl.lib.declarations.Plugin.country_module>` is back because we
want a default value for it.  The default value and only choice for
this option is currently the Belgian declaration (even :mod:`cosi3
<lino_book.projects.cosi3>` uses it), but that's just a matter of
time.
      
And :meth:`lino_xl.lib.sepa.mixins.Payable.get_wanted_movements`
didn't yet work when :mod:`lino_xl.lib.vat` was not installed (as is
the case in :ref:`welfare`).

I almost finished adapting the test suites, but I now realize that the
current implementation doesn't support the case of companies who
declare to more than one country.  So the next step will be to move
most of the declarations plugin to vat, and to write independant
plugins for every country: :mod:`lino_xl.lib.bevat`,
:mod:`lino_xl.lib.devat`, :mod:`lino_xl.lib.luvat` etc.
     
I am looking forward to do these changes, but it seems that they need
to wait a week because tomorrow I am going to participate in a camp on
Saaremaa.
