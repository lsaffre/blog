:ref:`avanti` is advancing
==========================

I optimized the summary view of :class:`LanguageKnowledgesByPerson
<lino_xl.lib.cv.models.LanguageKnowledgesByPerson>` and adapted the
:ref:`welfare` test suite after yesterday's changes.

A small new feature: :class:`SubmitDetail
<lino.core.actions.SubmitDetail>` now closes the window when the
actor's :attr:`stay_in_grid
<lino.core.tables.AbstractTable.stay_in_grid>` is `True`. This makes
the behaviour of :class:`LanguageKnowledgesByPerson
<lino_xl.lib.cv.models.LanguageKnowledgesByPerson>` more intuitive.

Coachings now a plugin on its own
=================================

I did :ticket:`1421`, which took me five hours: I forked the
"Coachings" functionality out of :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.pcsw` into
a plugin on its own, :mod:`lino_xl.lib.coachings`, which is going to
be used by both Welfare and Avanti.

This will require a database migration in :ref:`welfare` where models
`pcsw.Coaching` must be renamed to `coachings.Coaching`.  The same for
:class:`CoachingEnding`, :class:`ClientContactType` and
:class:`ClientContact` models.

It was a rather benedictine work, but it had to be done as it was
required for :ticket:`1400`. (Johanna and I realized this today).

I am proud of Lino because I believe that a change like this would
have taken *days* (not *hours*) with any other framework.

Rumma & Ko as Lino hosting provider
===================================

Today I also got constructive feedback on :ticket:`1395` from Roger.
