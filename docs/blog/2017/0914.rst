Yesterday I read `this thread
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17257031/django-unique-null-and-blank-charfield-giving-already-exists-error-on-admin-p>`__
and removed :class:`dd.NullCharField`.  And now I observed that it was
not enough to just allow nullable charfields now.  I also had to adapt
:meth:`lino.core.store.StoreField.form2obj` because now the field no
longer takes care of handling the special situation.  Added a test
case :mod:`lino_book.projects.adg.tests.test_nullchar` to cover this.
