I continued to explore :ticket:`1649` which is really a tough one.  I
added more debug messages in the hope of getting a clue.  I changed
them from `mysql-python` to `mysqlclient`. No change.  And then
finally I got it: it seems that the mysql client does not support
`newstr`! At least the problem disappears when I explicitly convert it
to a :func:`six.text_type` before. IOW this problem is yet another one
caused by the future package! I created :ticket:`1751`.


Hamza worked on :ticket:`1331`, so I tried to activate it on cpaseupen:
Installed redis and channels, did `pip install -U channels` followed
by `pip install 'Django==1.9.12'`, set their
:attr:`lino.core.site.Site.use_websockets` to True. But my browser
continues to not ask me whether their site may send desktop
notifications... so I deactivated it again. But it seems that they
will get it soon!
