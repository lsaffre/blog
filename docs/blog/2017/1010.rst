Internal optimizations of accounting stuff
==========================================

I continued to work on :ticket:`2101`:

- :cmd:`inv prep` now works for :ref:`welfare`.
- I started to update :ref:`xl.specs.accounting`.

It's an old challenge for every accounting package how to organize the
account chart. One aspect of this is which classification to use: PCMN
or some international variant. The classification choice is usually
not important for application code and should therefore be
transparent.  OTOH we need certain naming conventions.

- https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_comptable
- https://strategiccfo.com/standard-chart-of-accounts/

I realized that :class:`CommonAccounts` is something else than
:class:`AccountTypes`.


Side effects  

- New method :meth:`lino.core.actors.Actor.is_installed`
- The instantiator of a :meth:`lino.core.choicelists.Choice` now
  supports being called without any argument at all (which makes sense
  only for subclasses which define a value as class attribute).


  
Bugfix deploy for Avanti
========================

I upgraded the production site for :ref:`avanti` because Johanna had
hundreds of false data problem messages "Need to update phonetic
words" which did not disappear.

I also did some translations to German of several texts, e.g. "Sign
in" (:doc:`0921`) wasn't yet translated...
