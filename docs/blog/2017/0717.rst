I worked once more on my document :doc:`/topics/whyfree/index` because
I believe that our future salesman needs to understand these things.


I fixed a few bugs related to :ticket:`1933`:

- `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'vat_regime'`
  caused by a missing test in
  :meth:`lino_xl.lib.vat.VatDocument.fill_defaults`.

I wrote a bit of documentation in :ref:`xl.specs.ana`.
