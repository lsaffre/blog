===========================

I did a release in :ref:`welcht` and worked on :ticket:`1317`,
:ticket:`1318` and :ticket:`1301`.

I am in an observation phase: should I abandon this blog and write
everything as comments and sessions into our ticket management
instead?


I continued optimizing the tickets and votes workflow
(:ticket:`1359`).

New tables `MyVotes` and `MyWatched`.

I extended the :attr:`votable_overview` field which now uses
:meth:`get_overview_elems <lino.core.model.Model.get_overview_elems>`.

I added a new class attribute :attr:`filter_ticket_states
<lino_noi.lib.votes.models.Votes.filter_ticket_states>` on
:class:`Votes <lino_noi.lib.votes.models.Votes>`.  This is used by the
`MyTasks` and `MyOffers` tables.

An internal optimization: until today the :attr:`workflow_state_field`
of a `Model` was always a string with the name of a field. Now this
name is being resolved during startup and converted into a field.

:meth:`lino.core.model.Model.do_setup`
:meth:`lino.core.plugin.on_site_startup`
