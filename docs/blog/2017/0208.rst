===========================

More changes in :ticket:`1466`. I am still fiddling with presences and
who is responsible for the generated events. I had to extend the
:class:`EventGenerator <lino_xl.lib.cal.mixins.EventGenerator>` API
(adding a method :meth:`eventgen_user
<lino_xl.lib.cal.mixins.EventGenerator.gen_event_user>`).  I started a
new specs document :ref:`avanti.specs.courses`.

I moved the workflows module from Voga to XL because I want to use
that workflow in Avanti as well.
