==========================

I continued to work on :ticket:`2083`.

New rule for the :class:`EnrolmentChecker
<lino_avanti.lib.courses.EnrolmentChecker>`: when a reminder exists,
absences before that date are ignored.

The workflow for reminders is currently just my first quick draft.

New template files
:xfile:`courses/Enrolment/Default.odt`
and
:xfile:`courses/Reminder/Default.odt`
       
Side effect: The default :meth:`get_slave_summary
<lino.core.actors.Actor.get_slave_summary>` now adds an insert button
(if an insert_layout exists and user has permission).

DummyField now has a :meth:`__str__` method.

New fixture demo2 which adds primary coaches to the clients one
reminder.
