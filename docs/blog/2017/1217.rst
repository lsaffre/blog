Joining an existing household
=============================

Some optimizations in the :guilabel:`Household memberships` panel of a
person: I inverted the order of the fields in the params_layout of
:class:`lino_xl.lib.households.CreateHousehold`: (head type partner)
instead of (partner type head). That seems more intuitive.  Now we no
longer need to call this action using one link per household type.
Added a new link to join an existing household.

I released :ref:`atelier` version 1.0.13 on PyPI because :ref:`xl` was
`failing to build on Travis
<https://travis-ci.org/lino-framework/xl/builds/317546905>`__.
