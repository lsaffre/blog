Lino Roadmap


Find new developers:

- Find one or several students who would help Tonis. Tonis is able to
  mentor them.
- What would be their concrete project? Make Jane better.  Hamza would
  not get Jane but e.g. the connection to Google, or continue on the
  UI. Or the technical things.
  
- Improve the developers Guide
- Write documentation about Noi
  
- Update the text at
`VolunteerOpportunities
<https://wiki.python.org/moin/VolunteerOpportunities#Lino_application_developer>`__

Improve/upgrade the user interface

- Use the new ExtJS widgets
- Search for alternatives

Connection to Google

- Check whether CalDAV & CardDAV are enough for connecting with Google
- OAuth
- Google API

Upgrade technical dependencies

- Travis integration
- Python 3
- Django 1.11

  



Jane:

- meetings are not being used for meetings but for sprints or milestones
- duplicate the stars when duplicating a meeting
- Remove project and topic columns in most ticket tables, ad the site
  column.
