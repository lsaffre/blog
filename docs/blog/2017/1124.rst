Marketing work
==============

I finised by blog entry
`November 2017 <http://www.saffre-rumma.net/blog/>`__
which summarizes (in German) the last weeks.

I also updated the
:ref:`community`,
:ref:`hosters`
and
:ref:`developers` pages.

Optimizations in :ref:`avanti`
==============================
     
I continued with :ticket:`2157`.  Teachers complain that the sorting
order used for the guests of a calendar entry (which Lino fills from
the enrolments of a course) is not always the same.  And indeed,
:class:`GuestsByEvent` has no :attr:`order_by`, so it inherits the one
which is defined on :class:`Guests`::

  order_by = ['event__start_date', 'event__start_time']

Which definitively is not what we want.

Also the :class:`lino_avanti.lib.courses.PresencesByEnrolment` table
had no :attr:`order_by` specified because it did not inherit from
`cal.Guests`. So here we specify now manually::

    order_by = ['event__start_date', 'event__start_time']
  
I added a merge action for Client, Person and Company.

New field :attr:`lino_xl.lib.cal.EventType.transparent`.

Wrote demo data (EventType "Internal") & adapted test suites.


Optimizations in :ref:`tera`
============================


I started to write an import fixture for :ref:`tera` which imports
their "notes" and "topics" from TIM (:ticket:`2162`).

$ python manage.py loaddata i20171124


Release :ref:`avanti`
=====================

manual data migration:

- 
- coachings.CoachingEnding -> avanti.EndingReason
- coachings.Coaching and coachings.CoachingType were empty

Quick bugfixes en passant:
  
- when an admin user acts as an auditor, then Lino showed the full
  names (i.e. did not simulate what the subst_user would see)
- when cal.RecurrenceSet.max_events was 0, Lino did not remove all
  automatic events but used the site-wide default value.
