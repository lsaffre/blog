======================

I worked on :ticket:`1628` (Courses with every_unit "once" don't
generate their events as expected) because I plan to start user
trainings soon and this bug would disturb then.

- Wrote demo data for vilma.

- Every *activity series* can specify the organizer of this
  series. courses.Line now inherits from ContactRelated.

  TODO: check whether this disturbs for :ref:`voga` and Welfare. I
  guess that they might even be interested in this as a new feature.

- The summary of a course is now equal to the name of the series when
  every_unit is once.

- For courses whose every_unit is 'once', Lino no longer tries to find
  the next date if there are conflicting events. Rather issue a
  warning "Could not generate calendar event on DATE at 10:00 in
  ROOM".


public calendar view
====================

More optimizations for Vilma:  

- New field Room.description, and the detail window for rooms is back.
- new user role CalendarReader
