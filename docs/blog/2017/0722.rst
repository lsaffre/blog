=======================

I continued to work for :ticket:`1874`. Thanks to writing down
:ref:`tera.specs.tim2lino` I understood that individual therapies
shouldn't be implemented as `coachings.Coaching` but as
`courses.Course`. Also partner lists go away, these are courses as
well.

:func:`lino.utils.mti.mtichild` was originally written for avanti, but
now we need it in tera as well.


Optimizations in Amici
======================

I deactivated the :func:`site_setup` function in
:mod:`lino_xl.lib.contacts.models` which called
:meth:`set_detail_layout` for
:class:`lino_xl.lib.countries.Places`. That was an obsolete method
which disturbed now because I want a custom layout in
:ref:`amici`. And actually in every application which uses
:mod:`lino_xl.lib.addresses` we actually want the new
`AddressesByCity` table. This means that all applications which use
:mod:`lino_xl.lib.contacts` should now define that `detail_layout` in
their `custom_layouts` module. Might cause some coding work.

The default value for
:attr:`lino.modlib.checkdata.Plugin.responsible_user` must be set
in :meth:`on_plugins_loaded`, not in :meth:`pre_site_startup`. Because
otherwise we cannot override it in the Site's :meth:`setup_plugins`
method.
