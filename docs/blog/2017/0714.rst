Today I worked mostly on :ticket:`1960`.

I fixed a bug in :mod:`lino.utils.report` which caused
:class:`lino_xl.lib.accounting.ActivityReport` to always say "No data to
display", but then replaced the :class:`ActivityReport` by its
components (General accounts balance, Customer accounts balance and
Supplier accounts balance) as individual menu entries.

And then three new tables `PrintableInvoicesByJournal`
:mod:`sales <lino_xl.lib.trading>`, :mod:`vat <lino_xl.lib.vat>` and
:mod:`ana <lino_xl.lib.ana>`.

And a new report :class:`lino_xl.lib.ana.AnalyticAccountsBalance`
which inherits from :class:`lino_xl.lib.accounting.AccountsBalance` (do
you see why I love Python?).

Above changes caused quite some new entries to the
:menuselection:`Reports` menu which starts to be a bit crowded now.
Not yet sure how to solve this in an elegant way. Maybe a special
"reporting dashboard". Keep in mind that one day we will want a
feature of generating all legal accounting reports as pdf files in a
batch process

I fixed an old bug which caused entries of the
:menuselection:`Accounting` menu to not always be in the user's
language (by using :func:`django.utils.functional.lazystr`)
