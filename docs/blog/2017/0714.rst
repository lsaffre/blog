=====================

I worked on :ticket:`1960`.  I fixed a bug in
:mod:`lino.utils.reports`, but then deactivated the
:class:`lino_xl.lib.ledger.ActivityReport` and inserted its components
(General accounts balance, Customer accounts balance and Supplier
accounts balance) as individual menu entries.  And then a new table
:class:`lino_xl.lib.sales.PrintableInvoicesByJournal`.

A new report        
:class:`lino_xl.lib.ana.AnalyticAccountsBalance`.

Above changes caused a general review of the :menuselection:`Reports`
menu.  This menu starts to be a bit crowded now. Not yet sure how to
solve this in an elegant way. Maybe a special "reporting
dashboard". Keep in mind that one day we will want a feature of
generating all legal accounting reports as pdf files in a batch
process

I fixed an old bug which caused entries of the
:menuselection:`Accounting` menu to not always be in the user's
language (by using :func:`django.utils.functional.lazystr`)
