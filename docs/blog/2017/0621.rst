Yesterday and today I continued to work on miscellaneous optimizations
for :ref:`tera`.  Lydia reported the problem that she didn't find a
partner who had been in TIM as a "Zahler". That was because the first
name was ignored for companies.

- :mod:`lino_xl.lib.tim2lino.timloader1` now imports `PAR->Vorname`
  for companies.
