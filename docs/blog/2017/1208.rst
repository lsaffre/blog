Screenshot tours
================

I wrote documentation about :ref:`screenshots tours <dev.tours>`, and
a first example. Which lead to a few code changes in
:mod:`lino.api.selenium`.

The :xfile:`maketour.py` file for team is based on my earlier work in
:ref:`welfare`.  It currently generates only one screenshot because it
fails shortly after that first one. The traceback of this failure
shows that it happens somewhere below `send_keys
<http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/api.html#selenium.webdriver.common.action_chains.ActionChains.send_keys>`__. I
guess that the Selenium API has changed since I wrote that code.

Note also the file :file:`geckodriver.log` which might contain
interesting information.



Belgian eID card read error
===========================

I discovered that I cannot currently continue to work on
:ticket:`1275` because my Belgian eid card doesn't work.  The Belgian
eID viewer utility (version 4.1.18) says "Read error".

I don't think it is the reader device since I use it often with the
Estonian eid card, and also `pcsc_scan` reports something meaningful::

I asked for advice on `eid.belgium.be
<https://eid.belgium.be/fr/contact>`__. I guess that I will need to
get a new card next time I travel to Belgium.
This, :ticket:`1275` must wait.



Third-party authentication
==========================

I added a page :ref:`lino.socialauth` to the developer's guide.
