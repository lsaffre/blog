Screenshot tours
================

I wrote documentation about :ref:`screenshots tours <dev.tours>`, and
a first example. Which lead to a few code changes in
:mod:`lino.api.selenium`.

The :xfile:`maketour.py` file for team is based on my earlier work in
:ref:`welfare`.  It currently generates only one screenshot because it
fails shortly after that first one. The traceback of this failure
shows that it happens somewhere below `send_keys
<http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/api.html#selenium.webdriver.common.action_chains.ActionChains.send_keys>`__. I
guess that the Selenium API has changed since I wrote that code.

Note also the file :file:`geckodriver.log` which might contain
interesting information.
