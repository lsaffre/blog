"There was a problem with the database connection"
==================================================

When some server-side exception (even Warning) occured during the AJAX
call for populating a data store, then Lino simply said "There was a
problem with the database connection..."  without giving any
detail. Now the :func:`Lino.on_store_exception` handler in
:xfile:`linoweb.js` displays the content of `response.responseText` as
well.  I also optimized the message text from "If the error persists,
try reloading your browser" to "If the error persists, try reloading
the browser page".

Above misbehaviour was disturbing when there was no VAT rule
configured for an invoice.

TODO: adapt the :xfile:`linoweb.js` for :ref:`extjs6` accordingly.


Error messages during an action call
====================================

I optimized the text of another error message "No VAT account for None
None Normaler MwSt-Satz 0.2100"  which occured when Lydia tried to
register an invoice where the VAT rules had been modified after
entering the invoice.

TODO: this error message is still not seen by the user (only on the
server log), the user just has a "Please wait" mesage which never
disappears.



I started to write a :manage:`qtclient` command for Lino.  This works
only under Python 3.  Which revealed a few places where our code base
was not yet Python 3 compatible.
