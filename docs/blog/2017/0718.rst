"There was a problem with the database connection"
==================================================

When some server-side exception (even Warning) occured during the AJAX
call for populating a data store, then Lino simply said "There was a
problem with the database connection..."  without giving any
detail. Now the :func:`Lino.on_store_exception` handler in
:xfile:`linoweb.js` displays the content of `response.responseText` as
well.  I also optimized the message text from "If the error persists,
try reloading your browser" to "If the error persists, try reloading
the browser page".

Above misbehaviour was disturbing when there was no VAT rule
configured for an invoice.

TODO: adapt the :xfile:`linoweb.js` for :ref:`extjs6` accordingly.
