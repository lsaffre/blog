Two problems after release@ welcht
==================================

I continue to like the idea (:doc:`0904`) of having no phantom row in
tables that have a (+) button (IOW an insert_layout), but there is one
place where it disturbs: when users used a double-click to that the
phantom row from within a slave table. New attribute
:attr:`force_phantom_row <lino.core.tables.Tables.force_phantom_row>`.

`cal.Events` was using two variables `pending_states` and
`fixed_states` when `observed_event` was `EventEvents.stable`
`EventEvents.panding`.  But these lists of states were being filled
(using `EntryStates.filter(fixed=False)`) at *module* scope, i.e. when
models were getting imported. That might have caused some troubles for
them: J'ai trouvé une anomalie pour le filtrage des rendez-vous quand
un "Évènement observé:" est spécifie.
