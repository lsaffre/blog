I started a new page :ref:`specs.phones`. First qustion was: which of
the book projects can I use for showing phones? Spontaneously I took
:ref:`vilma`.  So added phones to this.  Which made me see that Vilma
was actually broken due to some changes in meetings. But nobody
noticed it because there was no test for this.

I completely removed ticket management from Vilma because I am quite
sure that the Vilma project will rather become a kind of customized
contacts management for village activists. With a skills catalogue and
possibly a CMS.

I continued to work on the "synchronization" part which was not yet
seriously done at all. Now the following rules are implemented (but
not yet thouroughly tested):

- after activating the plugin on a production site for the first time,
  a :manage:`checkdata --fix` should create all contact details.
- updating a field on the owner should update the value of the
  corresponding primary item
- updating a primary item should update the owner field
