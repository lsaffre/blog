Lino Care II is ready
=====================

I worked on :ticket:`2072` (Lino Care version 2 without tickets) and
released it to their production site.

- The overview field is no longer a DisplayField but a HtmlBox. That's
  because we want it to have a scrollbar when there is not enough
  room to view it.
- :class:`lino_xl.lib.addresses.AddressOwner` now supports being used
  when the :mod:`lino_xl.lib.addresses` plugin itself is not
  installed.  This is used for :class:`lino_xl.lib.contacts.Partner`
  which now inherits from it.
