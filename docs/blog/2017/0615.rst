Purchase invoices and VAT
=========================

Yesterday Lydia and I stumbled over :ticket:`1906`.  In a first
approach I thought that this was caused by a bug in
:meth:`Sequenced.seqno_changed` (happening when I have two items
having seqno 1 and 2. Then I call MoveDown on the first. Or I manually
set its seqno to 2.) I created a new test case :mod:`test_sequenced`
in `cosi1` demo project. Which shows that this was a wrong track. There
is no bug.
Another possible explanation is simply that
:class:`lino_xl.lib.vat.VatRules` was not ordered.

Printing tables as pdf works again unter ExtJS6
===============================================

With Hamza I worked half an hour on :ticket:`1989`. It was indeed
caused by the fact that some variable in ExtJS hasbeen renamed from
"width" to "cellWidth".
