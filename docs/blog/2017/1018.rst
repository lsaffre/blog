After stumbling over Tim Kholod's nice blogpost `The simple way to
understand Django models <https://arevej.me/django-models/>`__, I
started to write :ref:`dev.models` (which mentions it).

I added two virtual fields to
:class:`lino_xl.lib.accounts.CommonAcccounts`, and added the table to
the Explorer menu.


Connect using a Belgian eID card
================================

I asked Google for "belgian eid python" and found `this page
<http://python-social-auth-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/belgium_eid.html>`__
which made me discover `Python Social Auth
<https://github.com/python-social-auth>`__.

It seems that for Belgium it's only `a few lines of code
<https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-core/blob/master/social_core/
backends/belgiumeid.py>`__.

There is also a backend for `Google OpenId, OAuth2, OAuth1, Google+
<https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-core/blob/master/social_core/backends/google.py>`__. That
might be interesting for Hamza who is working on :ticket:`2013`.
