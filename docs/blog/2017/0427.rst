Vilma
=====


I realized that I should restore the functionality which I removed
from :ref:`vilma` last :doc:`Friday <0421>`. With the subtle
difference that users won't see it.  Only system administrators and
project managers can see it, most users will be of user type
:class:`Collector <lino_vilma.lib.vilma.user_types.Collector>`
(koguja) which doesn't have the required roles.

A side effect is that our collected tickets and comments and Tanel's
worktime sessions are now back. Actually it was this side effect which
triggered me to do that step back to the future (and to do it now,
before people start working).  But the main reason for this move is
that "my feeling" says that one day all this functionality will be
useful.

For now there is only one change in :ref:`xl` : I removed
`PublicTickets` from dashboard.

TODO: We will need some more changes in XL because currently the
collector user does see some unwanted menu items:

- new roles CalendarUser and BloggerUser
- meetings should require the tickets.Triager role



Welfare
=======

I fixed :ticket:`1789`. This was a side effect of a recent change in
:meth:`lino.core.kernel.Kernel.run_action` which does now more severe
permission checkin.  The reason was that `Guests` had a wrong
`required_roles`::

    +    # required_roles = dd.login_required(dd.SiteStaff, OfficeUser)
    +    required_roles = dd.login_required((OfficeUser, OfficeOperator))
