Some optimizations for :ticket:`2223`.  This reactivates
:ticket:`1354` which had been sleeping. I implemented the test now as
a checker instead of using :meth:`full_clean`.

The :attr:`remark` of a UserType now defaults to the docstring of its
:attr:`role`. Used to generate a more meaningful information in a
document like https://de.welfare.lino-framework.org/users.html



Updating a beta site from a snapshot
====================================

One customer uses a "preview" site which shows their data as it would
look with the newest version.


Instead of writing database migrators it's easier to manually change
their restore.py:

- ClientContactTypes, ClientContacts and ClientStates now in clients, no longer in coachings

- def create_users_user(...
      ...
      kw.update(user_type=profile)

- aids_account
  suppliers_account
