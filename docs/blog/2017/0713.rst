I continued to work for :ticket:`1933` and added an example (in
:ref:`tera.specs`) for testing intracommunal purchases.

- :mod:`lino_xl.lib.vat.fixtures.novat` now creates a rule for intracom
  VAT.
     
- :mod:`lino_xl.lib.vat.fixtures.demo` assigns VAT regimes to
  partners.  Until now it also assigned useless regimes, i.e. for
  which there was no VAT rule.

- Fixed a bug which caused the returnable VAT to be added instead of
  removed from invoice total.

The :class:`lino_xl.lib.bevat.Declaration` now produces movements when
registered.
