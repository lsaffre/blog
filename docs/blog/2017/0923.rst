I added the `remark` field for GuestsByEvent in general (not only for
:ref:`avanti`.

I moved some code from :mod:`lino.modlib.changes.models` to a new
module :mod:`lino.utils.watch`. Because the fact of declaring
something to be watched is different from how this watching is to be
done.  Apllication code must replace::

     from lino.modlib.changes.models import watch_changes as wc
     
by::
  
     from lino.utils.watch import watch_changes as wc

The advantage is that an application can define change watchers, and
local system administrators can still decide to disable the
:mod:`lino.modlib.changes` plugin.
