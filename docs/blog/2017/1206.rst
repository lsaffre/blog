===========================

Now I finally finished what I started on Monday ago: :ticket:`1696`
(Site-wide global search) and its child :ticket:`1792` (quick search
with several words) are now done. (Of course there are more
optimizations to come). Summary of changes:
        

- New table :class:`lino.modlib.about.models.SiteSearch`.
- A new model class attribute
  :attr:`lino.core.model.Model.show_in_site_search` which can be set to
  `False` if you really don't want a model to occur in the site-wide
  search.

- For models with no char field at all
  (:class:`lino_xl.lib.ledger.MatchRule`), Lino returned always all
  objects, independently of what you entered as earch text.

- When then :attr:`quick_search` contains more than one word, Lino now
  returns rows which contain all words, but does not require them to
  be in the given order.

- I started a new specs page :ref:`dg.plugins.search`.
  
The :attr:`lino.core.model.Model.quick_search_fields` and
:attr:`lino.core.model.Model.quick_search_fields_digit` attributes are
now tuples of field descriptor objects (no longer frozenset of field
names).
