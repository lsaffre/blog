Some optimizations for :ref:`vilma` (:ticket:`1800`):

- Comments by person and by organisation
- Have Company inherit from :class:`Hierarchical` and manage nested
  lists using CompaniesByCompany
- filter parameters for person: company, skill
- added more demo data in :mod:`lino_book.projects.liina`

As a side effect of :ticket:`1800` I removed the `commentable_model`
plugin attribute which is now useless.  I also made Comment now
inherit from :class:`lino.modlib.comments.mixins.Controllable`.
