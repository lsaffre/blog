Some optimizations for :ref:`vilma` (:ticket:`1800`):

- Comments by person and by organisation
- Have Company inherit from :class:`Hierarchical` and manage nested
  lists using CompaniesByCompany
- filter parameters for person: company, skill
- added more demo data in :mod:`lino_book.projects.liina`

As a side effect of :ticket:`1800` I removed the `commentable_model`
plugin attribute which is now useless.  I also made Comment now
inherit from :class:`lino.modlib.comments.mixins.Controllable`.

And yet another experimental new feature is that I added the
:mod:`lino_xl.lib.addresses` plugin. But note that :ref:`vilma` uses
it only for persons (not for companies and partners in general as
:ref:`welfare` does). This required a few API optimizations in
:mod:`lino_xl.lib.addresses`.
