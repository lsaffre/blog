I did some general updates to the Lino Book.

I added a new optional argument `exclude` for
:func:`atelier.test.make_docs_suite`. And in book we use this to
"skip" the `docs/specs/printing.rst` file which continues to fail due
to :ticket:`1296`.

I changed the default label of :attr:`workflow_buttons
<lino.core.model.Model.workflow_buttons>` from "Actions" to
"Workflow". Which caused of course some changes in output resulting in
failures of test cases.  Which made me discover a bug in the new
DocTestCase: when a test case failed, and the output contained
non-ascii text, then the test reporter failed to report these
failures. Bug fixed, now the failures are being reported. I made a
checkin just to `show them
<https://travis-ci.org/lino-framework/book/jobs/270280051>`__).
