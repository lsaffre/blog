About intellectual freedom
==========================

I read `this article in German
<https://www.golem.de/news/urteil-dwd-darf-warnwetter-app-nicht-kostenlos-anbieten-1711-131169.html>`__.
It is getting more and more evident that humanity needs to choose
whether we want intellectual freedom or not.  If we want our children
and their children to remain capable of governing this planet, then we
need to fight for intellectual freedom.  The public domain is the
knowledge owned by us all, it is the fruit of the intellectual work of
many individuals.  We need to understand that the public domain is an
unalienable huge treasure owned by humanity, that this treasure is
more and more being monopolized and abused by rich individuals and
groups thereof.  We need to understand that copyright needs
fundamental revision in a world where intellectual work can be
re-published and transformed without technical limitation.  We need to
understand that knowledge which has been published cannot be private
property any more...

Oops, sorry, this was very intuitive.  Yes, I shouldn't waste my time
writing *about* these topics because nobody takes me for serious (and
because nobody will ever pay me for it).
