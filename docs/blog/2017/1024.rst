Last tests for :ticket:`2115` before deploying it to their production
site.  I changed how :class:`lino_xl.lib.cal.UpdateGuests` reports
about what it did.

During the data migration I had this message::

    Abandoning with 2 unsaved instances:
    - dupable.PhoneticWord {'word': [u'This field cannot be blank.']} (2 object(s) with primary key 1520, 1523)

  


Ha! I found a fix for :ticket:`1545` (tooltips don't show on buttons
without image)!
