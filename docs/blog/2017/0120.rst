I liked Dan Bader's comparison between karate and the art of
programming. In his `latest newsletter
<https://www.getdrip.com/deliveries/joo3ypwhgsnm858csufs?__s=fzqoigmxzpdcehieoqqn>`__
he writes:

    I like to think mastering programming as a skill is quite similar
    to mastering a physical skill like karate. [...]

    With both, it takes a long time to build up the right foundation. But
    once "muscle memory" starts kicking in, your progress can
    skyrocket. It's all about making it through that first rough patch of
    slow learning progress without losing your motivation.

    Mastering a programming language means lifelong learning. The topic is
    fractalâ€”there's always a way to expand your knowledge in some obscure
    way. One can hit critical mass in terms of knowledge and be called an
    expert, but it's unlikely a single person will "know it all".

    A seasoned programmer acts deliberately and with an economy of
    movement that a beginner can't yet understand. Biological differences
    like age, "IQ", play less of a role. The more experienced dev still
    codes circles around the eager newcomer.


I continued working on :ref:`avanti`.
