I continued my avalanche of changes for :ticket:`1596` and then
released first to Vilma and then to Jane.

Funnily there was a problem on Jane which was *not* on Vilma::

  AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.

I worked around it by partly undoing what I did yesterday:
:func:`fields_list <lino.core.fields.fields_list>` has *not* become
more severe, it just issues a clearer error message when something has
no `name` attribute.

TODO: adapt test suites to my changes.
