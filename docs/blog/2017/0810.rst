Entering financial docs
=======================

Worked on :ticket:`1999`.


- show partner id in parentheses after the name when selecting the
  `partner` of a finan voucher item. Refused because their actual
  problem is having duplicate partners.

- cal.Event.project was empty after hitting (+) in EventsByCourse

  changed `project_model` from 'tera.Client' to 'courses.Course'.

- New field :attr:`lino_xl.lib.accounting.Journal.auto_fill_suggestions`

- :class:`DatedFinancialVoucherItem` no longer uses :func:`dd.today`
  as default value when a new line is created.

- New warning "No account specified for {item}" when no account was
  specified.

- item_account and item_remark now shown in detail layout of
  JournalEntriesByJournal
- In a JournalEntry item, after entering an account and if amount
  is empty, Lino now suggests the sum of the other items.


Two more optimizations a 10:30am:

- I set `slave_grid_format` of :class:`FinancialItemsByVoucher` from
  `grid` to to `html`. Seems that it had been like this before, and
  that it had been deactivated. To be observed why.
  
- The `description` of :class:`MovementsByMatch` did not show the
  partner of financial voucher items.
