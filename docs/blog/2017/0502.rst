====================

Today I reported most of my activities directly into Jane. No need to
mirror them here.  This developer blog seems more comfortable for
"spontaneous group tickets" (small list of unticketed optimizations),
though even then I now tend to create a ticket in Jane (as I did
e.g. for :ticket:`1800`).

The blog still might be more natural to talk about complex problems
which cover more than one ticket, philosophical and strategic
thoughts, announcements and reports of events...

IOW there might be less traffic here in the future.
