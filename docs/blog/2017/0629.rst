Today I continued on :ticket:`1933`.

The Belgian VAT declaration is a beautiful example of a historically
grown collection of rules, exceptions to the rules and exceptions to
these exceptions.  I am having the honorable and fun duty of
translating this to Python. See the code at
:mod:`lino_xl.lib.declarations.be`.

I checked in although the presto test suite is failing and although it
is not finished (e.g. currently all fields have value 0).
