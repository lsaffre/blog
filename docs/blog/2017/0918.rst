The Developer's Guide is getting better
=======================================

I checked in the work I did during the weekend: :ticket:`40`
and :ticket:`2072`. I wrote to Doti: 

    I must admit that each time I look into the Developers Guide for
    some mentee, I see many things to improve. Also this week-end I
    did lots of changes. Reload your browser pages. The "Getting
    started" section has currently 5 chapters, and I am now more or
    less satisfied, you can read them all. I don't yet recommend to
    read beyond the first section because I plan work on the second
    section soon. Thanks for motivating me :)

release@spz
===========

I deployed to SPZ for :ticket:`2070`. Some minor changes while testing
the new feature on their site. I am satisfied with my idea of having
Lino handle payment orders like payable "invoices" with the bank as
"supplier".


Jane is slow when showing tickets
=================================

Tonis discovered that after my changes on :blogref:`20170913`,
:meth:`disabled_fields` is being called twice per row.  I wrote the
new utility function :func:`lino.api.doctest.add_call_logger` to show
the problem:

>>> from lino import startup
>>> startup('lino_book.projects.team.settings.demo')
>>> from lino.api.doctest import *
>>> add_call_logger(rt.models.tickets.Ticket, 'disabled_fields')
>>> demo_get('robin', 'api/tickets/ActiveTickets', fmt="json", limit=1)
disabled_fields() on <class 'lino_noi.lib.tickets.models.Ticket'> was called
disabled_fields() on <class 'lino_noi.lib.tickets.models.Ticket'> was called

To be continued tomorrow.
