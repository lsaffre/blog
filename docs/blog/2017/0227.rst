Yesterday I moved almost all plugins from :mod:`lino_cosi.lib` to
:mod:`lino_xl.lib`, now I opened :ticket:`1529` because this is of
course not a trivial change.

But where to write documentation and functional specs about accounting
stuff?  Until now they were in :ref:`cosi`, but all these plugins are
now part of :ref:`xl`, so they should be documented and tested in
:ref:`book`.

Answer : yes, I will merge documentation from cosi into book. Because
it is impossible to explain Lino without examples, and the Lino Book
is *the* place where such examples should be, and because it sounds
difficult to explain Lino without talking about accounting stuff. And
it is unefficient to have accounting examples spread over different
repositories.


So I moved the following documents to :ref:`book.specs`:
