I continued to work for :ticket:`1874`.  Today I converted
:mod:`lino_xl.lib.tim2lino.spzloader` to the new database layout
(using activities instead of coachings). And there are first visible
results! (though I cannot show them here since they are on
confidential data ;-) Tomorrow will deploy it to their production site
and analyze them with Lydia.
