Lino Vilma workshop with Jüri and Tanel
=======================================

Yesterday we had a workshop about Lino Vilma with Tanel and Jüri. I
had invited four other people (Liina, Ilona, Krista, Anneli). But
these are very busy people and my invitation was sent out far too late
so that none of them was able to assist. Here is my invitation text
because it might give a picture of the situation:

    Tere, täna kl 16:30 toimuvad esimesed Lino Vilma mõttetalgud. Vähemalt
    Jüri ja Tanel ja Luc on lubanud osaleda. Liina, Ilona, Krista ja
    Anneli oleksid vägagi teretulnud.  Asi toimub kuskil TTK
    ruumides. Võta oma sülearvuti kaasa kui olemas.

    Talgude eesmärk : Paneme paika, millised funktioonid on mõttekas
    hakkata kasutama.  Hakkame kirjutama käsiraamat tulevastele
    kasutajatele (jätta endale selle lingi igaks juhuks kuskil meelde)

    Lino Vilma ("Village manager") on andmebaasirakendus, mida minu
    meelest peaks igal külal olema, sest see võimaldab inimestel omavahel
    suhelda hoopis teisel tasandil kui Facebooki kaudu. Kui mina oleksin
    külavanem, siis ma kindlasti tahaks sellist andmebaasi. Vilma on
    peaaegu sama programm, mida kasutan omaenda töö korraldamiseks - mul
    on kliendid Belgias ning programmeerijad Tallinnas ja Tuneesias.

    Praegu on Vilma alles visioon. Aga ma usun sellesse nii väga, et
    maksan isegi Tanelile palka. Tänan Liinat, kes mõtles juba kõvasti
    kaasa ja kes hakkab meile rahasid taotlema. Nüüd on aeg natuke
    laiemaks minna.

    Näeme võib-olla täna õhtul. Kui Sa täna nii äkkiliselt ei saa tulla,
    siis loodan ikka Sinu peale.

So yesterday we were only three: Tanel, Jüri and me. But actually
three people was enough.

It turned out that we *don't* need to write a *user's manual*
(käsiraamat) because normal users don't read manuals.  Yes I knew this
before, but I needed Tanel to realize it.

We don't need a *user's manual* (käsiraamat) but a *tutorial* (õpetus,
koolitaja käsiraamat).  We need a book to be used and maintained by
the people who are going to train future Lino users.  This tutorial is
currently in a document on Google Drive:

    `Lino Vilma koolitaja käsiraamat
    <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zBQcjtrkjcVqBFOwpHQX_2gHI0FEKmGc09SwerSEl_Y/edit?usp=sharing>`__

It makes no sense to have this document only on my machine because we
must find a team of persons who take responsibility for it.  Tanel
will also need this document in order to understand what we are doing
and why we do it, in order to explain it to stakeholders.  Wow, what a
big project!

I then explained Lino Vilma to Jüri.  A summary of what I explained to
Jüri (and what I suggest that future trainers should explain to their
trainees) is currently in that document on Google Drive. I updated
that document this morning. Jüri later suggested that we might record
my talk next time, cut it into pieces and build a virtual training.

And, as expected, there is another nice list of little code changes to
do:

DONE (Luc):

  "Lipikuliiged" --> "Lipikuolekud"

- translations:
  "Calendar entry" = Sündmus
  "Calendar entry types" = Sündmuste liigid
  
- "Lipikuliiged" is used for both Ticket states and ticket types
  
- WishesByTicket : label should be "agenda item in:" ("Päevakorras
  üritustel:")
  
- the "Summary" of a calendar entry should rather be labelled "Short
  description"
  
TODO (Tonis):

- It should be possible to directly add uploads and comments to an
  event (courses.Course) and to a person or company.
  
- Change Extensible Calendar cofiguration : 24h and 6h-22h
  
- cal.Guest.partner : should be a pointer to Person, not to Partner.
  
- topics.Topic should be Hierarchical (and then in configuration menu
  two entries AllTopics and TopLevelTopics as e.g. in
  :mod:`lino_xl.lib.faculties`)
  
- DuplicatesByTicket : readonly and with summary panel

- Show uploads in the list of comments. That is, the insert dialog for
  uploads should have an additional text field, and if the user writes
  something in that field, Lino stores that text as a comment.
  
- Activity line (ürituste sari) : should not be mandatory. e.g. a
  default value if empty. Courses.insert_layout should rather include
  the name of the course.
  
- UpdateVote and CreateVote : these detail windows should close afer
  every save

- VoteDetail should not have a (+) button (insert_action)

- Add a field cal.Room.place (FK to countries.Place). If this field is
  empty and partner isn't (i.e. either company or contact_person),
  then fill it from partner.
  
TALK (next time):

- UserTypes designations
- Voting workflow is not yet finished.
- Do we need a visual tool for moving tickets around (like Google
  Keep)?
  
- How to send a photo from phone to Vilma (waiting for :ticket:`1556`)
- How to publish calendar entries (waiting for :ticket:`1201` )
  
- cal.Room doesn't need to be Hierarchical because every room will
  have a company or at least a place
  
- verbose_name of topics.Topic should not be "Topic", but rather "News
  channel" in Vilma and "Component" in Team.
  

Repaired test suites
====================

I must now adapt the test suites to my changes of the last days so
that Tonis can start the stable branches. Currently he is locked
because it is difficult for him to decide whether a failure is mine or
not.

En passant I also integrated the specs of cosi into book, as I did
with noi some days ago. Tonis and I have the impression that this is
the right direction.  It is possible that we *don't* need to do this
also for voga and welfare and presto and avanti because noi and cosi
already provide a nice "demo context" for explaining the Lino
framework.  Okay Voga and Presto might be interesting to also
integrate, but Welfare and Avanti are quite specific to Belgian public
administrations (which is not bad, but at the worldwide level it is
not much).

So e.g.  :mod:`lino_noi.lib` and :mod:`lino_cosi.lib` now point to the
API section of the Lino Book.  And :ref:`specs.cosi.finan` or
:ref:`specs.cosi.apc` point to the Specs section of the Lino Book.

I am not yet decided what to do with :ref:`noi` and
:ref:`cosi`. Actually they should be available only in my blog and
point to the end-user docs.
