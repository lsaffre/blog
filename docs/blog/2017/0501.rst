===================

The Python `doctest` module (and also :mod:`atelier.doctest_utf8`)
have a magic behaviour: when testing a file whose name ends with
``.py``, the file gets loaded completely differently (it gets imported
as a Python module, and the global namespace is added to the test
namespace).  I tried to deactivate this magic behaviour because it
disturbs e.g. when testing :mod:`lino.utils.ssin`. But that would
problably cause lots of code changes. I will rather go the prosa
documentation way.
