===================

I continued to optimize :ref:`vilma`  (:ticket:`1800`).

The Python `doctest` module (and also :mod:`atelier.doctest_utf8`)
have a magic behaviour: when testing a file whose name ends with
``.py``, the file gets loaded completely differently (it gets imported
as a Python module, and the global namespace is added to the test
namespace).  I tried to deactivate this magic behaviour because it
disturbs e.g. when testing :mod:`lino.utils.ssin`. But that would
problably cause lots of code changes. I will rather go the prosa
documentation way.

The default value for the :attr:`lino_xl.lib.addresses.partner_model`
attribute is currently still the old hard-coded value
``'contacts.Partner'``, and the model currently does not need to be a
subclass of :class:`lino_xl.lib.addresses.mixins.AddressOwner`. That's
because there are a few places where it would fail otherwise. 

Workflow and user roles for votes were not yet reactivated.

I removed the language field from the insert layouts in
:mod:`lino_xl.lib.contacts`. And for Person I added the `email` field.
