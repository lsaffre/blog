I merged Hamza's `PR (Fix editing time field from the GridPanel)
<https://github.com/lino-framework/extjs6/pull/71>`__ for
:ticket:`1342`.

I continued the final sprint for the next release at :ref:`oikos`
(:ticket:`1315`):

The word "reporter" is going to vanish from :ref:`noi` because its
meaning is not clear. The fact that one user "reports" a ticket in
behalf of another user is now expressed by filling the field
`end_user` (:ticket:`1360`)

The :mod:`lino_noi.lib.faculties` plugin no longer needs
:mod:`lino_xl.lib.topics`. I completely removed the "topic" of a
faculty because this whole idea of linking them was probably bullshit.
(:ticket:`1361`)

I (hopefully) fixed some subtle issues which I summarize as
:ticket:`1364`.

The author, the watchers and the raters. I added a ` unique_together`
clasue on :class:`lino_noi.lib.votes.Vote`.
