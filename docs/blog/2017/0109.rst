I merged Hamza's `PR (Fix editing time field from the GridPanel)
<https://github.com/lino-framework/extjs6/pull/71>`__ for
:ticket:`1342`.  And (at 08:24) another PR for :ticket:`1337`.

I continued the final sprint for the next release at :ref:`oikos`.

- The word "reporter" is going to vanish from :ref:`noi` because its
  meaning is not clear. The fact that one user "reports" a ticket in
  behalf of another user is now expressed by filling the field
  `end_user` (:ticket:`1360`). This change caused en passant some
  optimizations of the demo data. E.g. the system admins (Robin, Rolf,
  Romain) no longer do actual work. Or Dora (in :ref:`care`) is an
  offline user managed by Eric who writes her ticket in behalf of her.

- The :mod:`lino_noi.lib.faculties` plugin no longer needs
  :mod:`lino_xl.lib.topics`. I completely removed the "topic" of a
  faculty because this whole idea of linking them was probably bullshit.
  (:ticket:`1361`)

- The author, the watchers and the raters.  I (hopefully) fixed some
  subtle issues which I summarize as :ticket:`1364`.  I added a
  `unique_together` clause on :class:`lino_noi.lib.votes.Vote`.

I adapted the test suites, checked in (`f7715a9
<https://github.com/lino-framework/noi/commit/c0ee3074dd8373f47ff6ef45a0ec3b0cbf7715a9>`__)
and sent a mail to the users (:ticket:`1315`).
