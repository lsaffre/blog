The odd behaviour is probably because it is a chooser with
`simple_values=True`. In that case the combobox behavesvery
differently and does not provide pagination because that would be
difficult to implement when the data is not in a database.  Such
choosers usually show a reasonable number of rows. Note that filtering
works (users just need to know...).

I suggest to add a :meth:`full_clean` method to
:class:`lino.modlib.users.mixins.TimezoneHolder` which protects us
from having invalid values.
