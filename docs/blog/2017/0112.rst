Yet another series of chaotic (intuitive) changes for :ticket:`1359`.

I realized that it is not (easily) possible to render workflow actions
for both the vote and the ticket in the same table.

And I realized that single column tables with multi-line text cells
are not efficient for a desktop application.

And I decided that the body notification messages now uses memo markup
for linking to tickets. This markup is then rendered differently
depending on *where* it is being rendered.  In the dashboard, it links
to:

    javascript:Lino.tickets.Tickets.detail.run(null,{ "record_id": 115 })

while in an email it links to:

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/tickets/PublicTickets/111


In the evening we had a first work session with three participants:
:ref:`hamza`, :ref:`tonis` and I. I shared my screen, showed them what
I had been doing during the day, then made a deploy of these changes
to :ref:`lf`. Here is a list of the commits we made together (and
without caring for running the test suite each time):
