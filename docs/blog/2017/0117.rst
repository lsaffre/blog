I continued on :ticket:`1392`. The new vote state `author
<lino_noi.lib.votes.choicelists.VoteStates.author>` was one of my
latest ideas yesterday, and I seem to like it. The `VotesByVotable`
table now hides the author votes.

And then I did (for :ticket:`40` and visible in :ref:`dev.actions`)
something which has been waiting a long time: I renamed Lino's three
most-used core actions:

- GridEdit -> ShowTable
- InsertRow -> ShowInsert
- ShowDetailAction -> ShowDetail
