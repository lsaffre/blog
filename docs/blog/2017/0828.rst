I finally did something which had been waiting for long: I modernized
the book test suite.

the test suite is no longer defined in a single file
:file:`__init__.py` but in a series of files :file:`test_*.py`.

doctests are now being discovered automatically : it is no longer
necessary to add new tested rst files to the test suite (and it is no
longer possible to have untested rt files).

pytest.ini

The biggest work was converting the deprecated tutorials under
`docs/tutorials` to `lino_book.projects`
