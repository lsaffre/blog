For :ticket:`2162` I realized that in :ref:`tera` we need *both*
:mod:`lino_xl.lib.lists` and :mod:`lino_xl.lib.topics`(not just one of
them).  *Partner lists* will be used by secretaries while *topics* are
confidential, i.e. reserved to therapists. I adapted my yesterday
import fixture (:mod:`i20171124`).
