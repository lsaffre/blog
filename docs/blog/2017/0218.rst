Tonis and I had a big HO session where we moved saffre-rumma.net to a
new server (:ticket:`1271`). This was basically routine work,
verifying the docs and starting to think about how we can make this
automatically.

We added an MX record for saffre-rumma.net (at www.zone.ee)

We get certificates as explained in 
https://certbot.eff.org/#debianjessie-apache

When installing libreoffice, I saw that they deprectated the single
dashes in theor command-line interface::

  $ /usr/bin/libreoffice --accept="socket,host=127.0.0.1,port=8100;urp;" --nologo --headless --nofirststartwizard

  $ /usr/bin/libreoffice -accept="socket,host=127.0.0.1,port=8100;urp;" -nologo -headless -nofirststartwizard

As a result, our ticketing database is now at
https://jane.saffre-rumma.net/

As you can see, we also changed its name from "Mio" to "Jane". It will
need some time for us all to get used to the new name, but I believe
that Mio was just too bad as name. Let's hope that Jane (who shares
her first name with Agatha Christie's Miss Marple) will become more
and more helpful in her job: collecting and remembering information
about everything from everywhere.
