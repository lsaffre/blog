=========================

The following views now require :class:`ClientsUser
<lino_avanti.lib.avanti.ClientsUser>` role (i.e. are no longer visible
for teachers and auditors):
       
- :class:`lino_avanti.lib.courses.Reminders`
- :class:`lino_xl.lib.extensible.CalendarPanel` (NB this is done by
  setting `required_roles` in :mod:`lino_avanti.lib.avanty.layouts`).

I added coverage for testing these user permissions in
:ref:`avanti.specs.roles`.

The :class:`MoveEntryNext <lino_xl.lib.cal.MoveEntryNext>` action
(:guilabel:`â–½`) now asks for confirmation and is no longer available
on entries in a fixed state.
