Today we got started with Valentin and Benjamin at AbAKUS for setting
up a new server which will host a customer's production site.  They
are qualified people with much experience about Linux, Apache, DNS and
Odoo. They didn't yet have experience with Django. They liked Lino
quite much and understand the differences between Lino and Odoo. After
this session we can be optimistic that AbAKUS will bring more and more
engagement to Lino during the coming years.

Afterwards I reviewed the installation instructions for hosting
providers (:ref:`lino.admin.install`). I changed `lino_sites` to
`prod_sites` because it saves one :kbd:`TAB` keypress when entering a
project path on the command-line.
