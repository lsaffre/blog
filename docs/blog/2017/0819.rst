The user field of [ticket 2004] is currently empty. Change history
says that Tonis changed it from its original value to empty. How did
that happen?

Alternatives to ExtJS
=====================

While PyQt is a possible alternative, it has the disadvantage of
needing some software to be installed on the client machine.  I
invested some time looking at Qooxdoo and Dojo which don't have this
disadvantage.

First Qooxdoo (for which I wrote a proof of concept some years ago,
but at that time I abandoned and cannot remember why):

- http://www.qooxdoo.org/demos.html
- http://www.qooxdoo.org/5.0.2/pages/tool/getting_started.html

I read Bob Mang's impressions after a week of Qooxdoo `20151105
<https://ext2qooxdoo.wordpress.com/2014/11/05/extjs-vs-qooxdoo-the-obvious-differences/>`__
but that blog ends with the entry `Dojo wins
<https://ext2qooxdoo.wordpress.com/2015/11/20/dojo-wins/>`__ So I also
had a look at Dojo:

- https://dojotoolkit.org/documentation/tutorials/1.10/hello_dojo/
- https://dojotoolkit.org/documentation/tutorials/1.10/datagrid/index.html

My conclusion: both toolkits seem valid candidates. I should
investigate both of them, starting with Qooxdoo because Dojo announced
a version 2 which is not yet available.
