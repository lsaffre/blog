Miscellaneous optimizations
===========================

I adapted the test suites for :ref:`welfare` after my recent changes.

In :ref:`voga` I added the :class:`lino.modlib.about.SiteSearcher`
role to all user types.

New field :attr:`lino_xl.lib.phones.ContactDetail.end_date`. And the
summary panel of :class:`lino_xl.lib.phones.ContactDetailsByPartner`
now hides away items whose :attr:`end_date` is not empty.

In :ref:`amici` we sometimes want to store "historic" roles of a
person, for example the fact that somebody has been working somewhere
*from* a given date or *until* a given date. We want two additional
fields :attr:`start_date <lino_xl.lib.contacts.Role.start_date>` and
:attr:`end_date <lino_xl.lib.contacts.Role.end_date>`. We can inject
them in :ref:`amici`, or we can extend the plugin there. But it seems
to me that this feature might be wanted by other applications as well.
Therefore it should be implemented as a configuration option of the
contacts plugin.
