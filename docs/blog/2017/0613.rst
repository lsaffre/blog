Optimizaing data entry of invoices and journal entries
======================================================

Today Tonis and I worked on :ticket:`1891` which is urgent because
Lydia waits for it.

Sum of invoice was mostly a config problem (missing VAT
rule). Optimized an error message.

The wrong behaviour when reordering was because get_siblings was not
being ordered by seqno. We now say that get_siblings does not need to
specify the ordering. Because the calling code can always add
it. There are cases where you want another ordering or no ordering at
all.

We decided to set :attr:`preview_limit
<lino.core.tables.AbstractTable.preview_limit>` to 0 for
:class:`lino_xl.lib.finan.ItemsByVoucher`.


Writing a PR for Django
=======================

For :ticket:`1329` Tonis and I did some more changes to Lino and `our
Django fork <https://github.com/lsaffre/django/tree/ticket_20313>`__
so that the pull request becomes even smaller.


I then created `PR #8635
<https://github.com/django/django/pull/8635>`__ (Separate
authorisation from authentication) and Django ticket `#28302
<https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/28302>`__.
