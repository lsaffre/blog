After `this failure <https://travis-ci.org/lino-framework/welfare/jobs/276021210>`__ I (partly) futurized :ref:`welfare` by applying the following::

    $ futurize -nw1 .
    $ futurize -nw -f libfuturize.fixes.fix_unicode_keep_u -f libfuturize.fixes.fix_future_builtins .

I added Python 3 to the :xfile:`.travis.xml` of :ref:`voga`. And then
also ran a limited futurize on it.
