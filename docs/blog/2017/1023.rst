I continued to work on :ticket:`1275`.
Here are some error messages I have seen today.

:: 

    {error: "idpiframe_initialization_failed",
      details: "Not a valid origin for the client:
        http://127.0.0.â€¦itelist this origin for your project's client ID."}
    {error: "idpiframe_initialization_failed",
      details : "Not a valid origin for the client:
        http://127.0.0.1:8000 has not been whitelisted for client ID ....
        Please go to https://console.developers.google.com/ and whitelist
        this origin for your project's client ID."}

I went to the Google console and added http://127.0.0.1:8000 to the
*Authorised JavaScript origins*. This didn't help at first. But when I
tried again two hours later, it worked. So it seems that Google needs
some time to update the Web application after a change of
configuration.

Next error message was this::

    {
      "error" : "invalid_request",
      "error_description" : "Permission denied to generate login hint for target domain."
    }


Thanks to `this

I changed my URL from http://127.0.0.1:8000 to http://localhost:8000
and added added also http://localhost:8000 to the *Authorised
JavaScript origins*.
