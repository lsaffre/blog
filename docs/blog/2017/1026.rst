Running linkcheck on the Lino Book
==================================

I opened :ticket:`2128`, a task for newbies::

  $ go book
  $ sphinx-build -b linkcheck docs docs/.build

Then edit the file :file:`docs/.build/output.txt` and fix all errors.
But before you begin to work on this, speak with one of the team and
make sure that you cah check in your work.


Login via Google+
=================

I continued on :ticket:`1275`.
I can now choose my account,
but something goes wrong afterwards.

- The browser sends a GET to
  https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/iframerpc with these
  parameters::

    action:issueToken
    response_type:token id_token
    login_hint:...
    client_id:....apps.googleusercontent.com
    origin:http://localhost:8000
    scope:openid profile email
    ss_domain:http://localhost:8000

  It receives a valid response::

    access_token: "ya29....GrjA"
    expires_in: 3600
    id_token : "ey...Talg"
    login_hint: "..."
    scope: "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.me openid email profile"
    session_state: {extraQueryParams: {authuser: "0"}}
    token_type: "Bearer"

- Then the browser sends a POST to
  http://localhost:8000/complete/google-plus/ which receives an 403 error::

    HTTPError: 403 Client Error:
    Forbidden for url:
    https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/people/me?access_token=ey...lg&alt=json
