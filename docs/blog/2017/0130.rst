I worked on :ticket:`1438` : I plan Tanel to become the webmaster of
our `company website <https://www.saffre-rumma.net/>`__

The site is made using Nikola, and I am satisfied with it. The main
reason for not using Sphinx for our site is that Nikola handles
multilingual sites better and is more user-friendly.

First step was to put the source files to public GitHub repository
https://github.com/saffre-rumma/www

The only little issue was: my username was hard-coded in the Nikola
config file.  How are we going to make that username configurable?
This was less trivial than expected because there are so many ways to
do it.

We explored whether we should use GH pages for hosting these pages
instead of wasting our expensive server space.  But our pages take
only about 6 MB, and I prefer to remain independent at that level.

The final answer (or at least I hope so) came last night: I extended
:mod:`atelier.invlib` so that it supports also Nikola doc trees.
So Tanel must just configure his `~/.invoke.py` file.

I like this solution, but --yes as usual-- it needs more
documentation.
