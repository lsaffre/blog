Puppeteer
=========

I tried to run the puppeteer test suite in react::


  (dev) luc@frodo:~/work/react$ npx puppeteer browsers install chrome
  Downloading chrome 131.0.6778.204 - 165.9 MB [====================] 100% 0.0s
  chrome@131.0.6778.204 /home/luc/.cache/puppeteer/chrome/linux-131.0.6778.204/chrome-linux64/chrome

  (dev) luc@frodo:~/work/react$ npm test

  > lino_react@25.4.2 test
  > jest

  Error: Jest: Got error running globalSetup - /home/luc/work/react/lino_react/react/testSetup/setupJEST.js, reason: Failed to launch the browser process!

  [1185962:1185962:0519/073804.739181:FATAL:zygote_host_impl_linux.cc(128)] No
  usable sandbox! If you are running on Ubuntu 23.10+ or another Linux distro
  that has disabled unprivileged user namespaces with AppArmor, see
  https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/security/apparmor-userns-restrictions.md.
  Otherwise see
  https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/linux/suid_sandbox_development.md
  for more information on developing with the (older) SUID sandbox. If you want
  to live dangerously and need an immediate workaround, you can try using
  --no-sandbox.

      at ChildProcess.onClose (/home/luc/work/react/node_modules/@puppeteer/browsers/src/launch.ts:486:11)
      at ChildProcess.emit (node:events:531:35)

I read the mentioned  `Chromium Docs
<https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/security/apparmor-userns-restrictions.md>`__
and did as instructed there::

  echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns

Now the test suite works::

  (dev) luc@frodo:~/work/react$ npm test

  > lino_react@25.4.2 test
  > jest

  A worker process has failed to exit gracefully and has been force exited. This is likely caused by tests leaking due to improper teardown. Try running with --detectOpenHandles to find leaks. Active timers can also cause this, ensure that .unref() was called on them.

This looks well! I won't dive further now, I'm glad to have Sharif for the React
front end.
