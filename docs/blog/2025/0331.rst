Some days ago I upgraded `the software for using Estonian ID cards
<https://www.id.ee/artikkel/paigalda-id-tarkvara/>`__ and now :mod:`eidreader`
is broken, :cmd:`inv test` says::

  File "docs/usage.rst", line 191, in usage.rst
  Failed example:
      shell("eidreader")  #doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
  Expected:
      {"eidreader_version": "1.0.8", "success": false, "message": "Could not find any reader with a card inserted"}
  Got:
      {"eidreader_version": "1.0.8", "success": false, "message": "Middleware not properly installed"}
      src/dyn_unix.c:34:SYS_dyn_LoadLibrary() libbeidpkcs11.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

The following approach did not work::

  $ sudo apt remove libbeidpkcs11-bin
  ...
  The following packages will be REMOVED
    libbeidpkcs11-bin
  0 to upgrade, 0 to newly install, 1 to remove and 51 not to upgrade.
  ...
  Removing libbeidpkcs11-bin (5.1.18v5.1.18-0u2204-1) ...

  $ sudo apt install libbeidpkcs11-bin
  Reading package lists... Done
  Building dependency tree... Done
  Reading state information... Done
  Package libbeidpkcs11-bin is not available, but is referred to by another package.
  This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
  is only available from another source

I tried to reinstall Belgian eid software according to :ref:`eidreader.install`.
But they don't work on my computer, which I bought from a German company,
Tuxedo, who use install own variant of Debian called "Tuxedo OS". I asked from
Tuxedo for help, but they answered promptly that "Unfortunately we are unable to
offer support for the individual setup, configuration or use of software."
