The Ibanity staff activated our application, now I will configure Jane to use
it.

Creating a new application client certificate is more complicated for "live"
applications than for "sandbox" applications. The developer portal asks me

- to generate an RSA key pair::

    openssl genrsa -aes256 -out private_key.pem 2048

- and then to generate a Certificate Signing Request::

    openssl req -new -sha256 -key private_key.pem -out ibanity.csr \
    -subj "/C=BE/O=Isabel Group/OU=Isabel Group Certificate Authority/CN=Lino application account (abc123)/serialNumber=123456"

  This creates a file ibanity.csr

- and then to upload the :xfile:`ibanity.csr` file to their server.

In response, I receive a zip file with two files :file:`ca_chain.pem` and
:file:`certificate.pem`.


I assume that I should run these commands in the project directory of my Lino
site.
