:doc:`Yesterday <0118>` Geoffrey helped me to get a bit more of information::

  {"errors":[{"code":"invalidPayload","detail":"The submitted payload could not be parsed.",
  "meta":{"requestId":"00015ABF903CA9960A01063301BB678FE5E7E08D82DF"}}]}

His explanation to this error message is "Well, that we couldn't parse the
payload. an issue with the syntax. Sadly we can't see what, because we couldn't
parse it."

But what can be the problem? A blatant syntax problem is unlikely since I
specify the payload as a dictionary and the Python ``requests`` module converts
this to a stream. I have only the `Ibanity API documentation
<https://documentation.ibanity.com/einvoicing/1/api/curl#peppol-customer-search-object>`__,
and I cannot see anything that helps me.

I reduced my script to focus on my problem:

.. literalinclude:: 0122.py

Out of intuition I tried to change the "Content-Type" header from
"application/vnd.api+json" to "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".

And with the new Content-Type I get a new result::

  Exception: POST https://api.ibanity.com/einvoicing/customer-searches returned 404
  {"errors":[{"code":"resourceNotFound","detail":"The route you are trying to reach was not found."}]}

I tried all kind of variants of structuring the payload, and I added more
information copied from the API docs example (``supportedDocumentFormats`` and
``id``), but the response is always the same.

I don't even know whether this result is better than :doc:`yesterday <0118>` or
not :-/

The story goes on here: :doc:`0123`.
