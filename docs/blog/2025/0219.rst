How to reinstall my Lino developer environment after dist-upgrade
=================================================================

I did "pip freeze > 20250218.txt" before the dist-upgrade, but then didn't use
it because I preferred to say::

  go getlino
  pip install -e .
  getlino configure

I had a series of SyntaxWarning "invalid escape sequence" in a few files because
my Python is now Python 12 (it was 3.10 before). There is a beautiful
`discussion on python.org
<https://discuss.python.org/t/please-dont-break-invalid-escape-sequences/74134/2>`__
about why this is good.

getlino should maybe call :cmd:`pip install -e .[test]`
