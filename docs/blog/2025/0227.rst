The Ecosio validator says "[BR-CL-17]-Invoice tax categories MUST be coded using
UNCL5305 code list", but there are two such code lists:
`A <https://docs.peppol.eu/pracc/catalogue/1.0/codelist/UNCL5305/>`__ and
`B <https://docs.peppol.eu/poacc/billing/3.0/2024-Q2/codelist/UNCL5305/>`__.
One of them has a code "AA" for reduced VAT and the other one hasn't.
And my invoice contains indeed a line with reduced VAT.

Explanation: Haha! I was asking a rule set for Australia and New-Zealand. With
the "UBL Invoice 2.4" rule set, the invoices generated by Lino now pass.
