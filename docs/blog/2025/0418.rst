I worked on :ticket:`5754` (How to install esteid digidoc on Tuxedo OS) and
:ticket:`6007` (eidreader test suite fails with libbeidpkcs11.so.0: No such file
or directory)ï»¿. Seems that both issues are related. Difficult to get help
because nobody feels responsible.  After finding and installing the  `pyasice
package <https://pypi.org/project/pyasice/#quickstart>` I wrote a script
:file:`asice.py`, which is supposed to print the names of the people who signed
an `ASICE
<https://www.id.ee/en/article/bdoc-cdoc-and-asice-digidoc-file-formats-2/>`_
file::

  import click
  from pyasice import Container

  @click.command()
  @click.argument("filenames", nargs=-1)
  def main(filenames: tuple[str, ...]):
      """Show the signers of the specified .asice file."""
      for fn in filenames:
          try:
              cont = Container.open(fn)
              text = "Signatures: "
              for n, sig in enumerate(cont.iter_signatures()):
                  text += f"\n{n+1}) {sig.get_certificate().x509}"
          except Exception as e:
              text = str(e)
          print(fn, ":", text)

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      main()


I had the following traceback::

  Traceback (most recent call last):

  oscrypto.errors.LibraryNotFoundError: Error detecting the version of libcrypto


After reading `this thread on github
<https://github.com/wbond/oscrypto/issues/78>`__, worked around this for my
personal use by saying::

  $ pip uninstall oscrypto
  $ pip install git+https://github.com/wbond/oscrypto.git@d5f3437


Interesting to note that the author of oscrypto, Will Bond, seems a bit special.
Smells like frustration or burnout. In August 2023 somebody asked "I saw you
already fixed that in d5f3437, but as this is not released to pypi our Tool does
not fully work. Would it be possible to release a bug-fix version to pypi?", a
request that was then backed by half a dozen of other people who had the same
problem. And in October he finally found some time to write an answer: "No, this
is a free-time project for me. The commit is there, so it is certainly possible
to use most Python packaging tools to grab the sha of the commit."
