How to insert a local table of contents into a HTML page?  Except for some basic
examples I couldn't find something that actually inserts the TOC in a marked
place, complete with backlinks, and later updates that TOC.

.. literalinclude::
  1031.py

That was fun, but it's rather useless, because there are JS scripts for doing
this automatically and better.
