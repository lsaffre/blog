Thoughts about detail links
===========================

Imagine you are building the dashboard for user X in a Lino Noi. You render the
table of recent comments. At some moment you are there, with an instance of
:class:`comments.Comment` and want to render a link to the
:class:`comments.Comment.owner` of this comment. You call :meth:`ar.obj2html`,
which calls :meth:`Model.as_str` to build the displayed text and :meth:`obj2url`
to get the URL. Let's talk about that URL.
It uses the "default table".
:meth:`Model.get_default_table`


A different thing is when a row disappears from the list because of the end
user's change. For example, you are in the list of "Active tickets", showing the
detail view of one active ticket, and then you click on "Closed". Lino currently
gives you a "bad request" warning in this case,, which is wrong. The correct
behaviour here should be to skip to the next row, maybe with a warning "Ticket X
is no longer in Active tickets after your change" (although there are situations
where even this warning should get suppressed). If Lino cannot skip to the next
row (because you were on the last one), it should skip back to the previous row.
