To be meditated: What should be the default value for the ``group`` field of a
:class:`PrivacyRelevant`? When an end-user writes a comment, and the group is
not obvious from the context, Lino can set the user's `current_group`. But if
that happens to be empty as well? Okay technically the group field may be empty,
but right now a comment without a group wouldn't be visible even to its author.
I could change that rule and say that comments without a group are visible to
everybody, but that sounds dangerous on sites with very confidential data.  Okay
we have the plugin setting :data:`lino.modlib.users.private_default`.

Answer: a comment without a group should be visible (1) only to its author (and
to SiteAdmin) if it's marked private, and (2) to everybody if it's not marked
private.
