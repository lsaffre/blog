=======================
Sharif is back
=======================

Friday, January 3, 2025

Today is a historic day for Lino: Sharif and I had our first meeting after half
a year (see :doc:`/blog/2024/0802`). We took a screenshot to celebrate this
moment:

I am profoundly glad that he is healthy and back.  The Synodalsoft team is more
like a family than a company because we are such a small team with `such a big
and vague vision <https://www.synodalsoft.net/vision/>`__.

Another thing that makes us different from normal software development companies
is that  we do not have any clear plan. We have only 20 customers, and we manage
quite easily to satisfy their needs because Lino focuses on maintainability and
stability. So most of our work is research and development. We advance step by
step following our inner voice.  We have a lot of work and `we need new team
members <https://www.synodalsoft.net/jobs/>`__.
