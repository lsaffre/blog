About CLI libraries
===================

I read about `Typer <https://typer.tiangolo.com/#recap>`__, which is an
extension of `Click <https://click.palletsprojects.com>`__, which we use  at
different places in Lino, most notably :mod:`getlino`. In atelier and picsel we
still use  `argh <https://argh.readthedocs.io>`__, which is older than click.

GUI libraries for console terminals
===================================

I continue to dream about writing a command-line frontend for Lino.  Right now
it remains just a dream because it would be very experimental and nobody would
ever pay money for it...

... but still it would be a great project for a volunteer contributor. Here are
some libraries that we would consider to base our work upon.

- `Textual <https://textual.textualize.io/>`__
- `An introduction to npyscreen â€” npyscreen 2 documentation
  <https://npyscreen.readthedocs.io/introduction.html>`__
- `Urwid <https://urwid.org/>`__
- `Curtsies <https://github.com/thomasballinger/curtsies>`__


Computing with durations
========================

>>> from lino.utils.quantities import Duration
>>> def func(values):
...     values = values.split()
...     print(sum([Duration(x) for x in values]))

>>> func("-1:37 10:00 -6:31")
1:52

>>> func("-4:42 10:00 -0:11")
5:07
