About the doctest failures in specs/calview.rst and specs/avanti/db.rst
(avanti1):

The number of cal.Event changed from 278 to 533 (+155). The new events are
suggested meetings with clients according to their event_policy. Explanation:
the `generate_calendar_entries` procedure was not being run by `pm prep`, now it
is being run. Good.



About the doctest failures in projects/voga2.rst and plugins/checkdata.rst
(voga2):

(1) plugins/checkdata.rst modified the database but didn't run check_virgin(),
causing nasty surprises

(2) The `checkdata` procedure (which finds conflicting events) was being run
before `generate_calendar_entries` (which generates them)::

  $ pm show linod.Procedures

  =========================== =========================== =========================== ================== ===========================

Which means that checkdata messages appeared only during a second loop of the
task runner.

Both checkdata and generate_calendar_entries are daily background tasks.
