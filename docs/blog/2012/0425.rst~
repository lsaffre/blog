Sending mails from Lino
-----------------------

Renamed lino.apps.pim to :mod:`lino.apps.min1`.
See :term:`Minimal application`.
Added new application :mod:`lino.apps.min2`
to test and demonstrate Lino's mails and calendar funtionality.

Split :mod:`lino.modlib.mails`
into :mod:`lino.modlib.outbox` and :mod:`lino.modlib.inbox`.
The latter is for later, but the former now works and can actually send real mails.

Lino and :term:`ODFPy`
----------------------

As I said in :doc:`0421`,
"I remain open to the idea of getting back to ODFPy 
in case it turns out that Søren continues to maintain ODFPy,
because my method is not as beautiful and because :term:`lxml` 
has a disadvantage of not playing well with mod_wsgi in certain 
configurations (see )."

Søren confirmed that he does continue to maintain :term:`ODFPy`, 
so I converted 
:meth:`lino.utils.appy_pod.Renderer.insert_table` 
back to use :term:`ODFPy`.
