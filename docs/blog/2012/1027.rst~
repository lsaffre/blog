Who is Mark James?
------------------

I tried to say thanks to Mark James, the author of the 
Silk Icons...
but the email address mjames@gmail.com no longer exists.
And oops, according to 
`192.com <http://www.192.com/people/search/>`_
there are about 43 people named Mark James in Birmingham:

Jan Olsen obviously had similar problems, 
already back in 2009, before starting the 
`Silk Icons Evolved <http://code.google.com/p/famfamfam/>`_ project.



When updating my :doc:`/about/thanks` page I noticed that Lino 
included a file 
:srcref:`pyuca_allkeys.txt </lino/utils/pyuca_allkeys.txt>`,
an unmodified copy of `the original file 
<http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCA/latest/allkeys.txt>`_.
And although I understand their 
`Terms of Use <http://www.unicode.org/terms_of_use.html>`_
as giving me the right to do this, 
I have become more careful after my collision with 
Klaus Lüchtefeld from Köln.
This file presents an unnecessary risk of me having misinterpreted 
their copyright notice. 
So I removed the file and added a warning 
in :mod:`lino.modlib.vocbook.base`.


Homework Schools
----------------

Continued on :mod:`lino.apps.homeworkschool`.

One change in :mod:`lino.modlib.cal.models`: 
RecurrenceSet no longer is a ProjectRelated.
Because homeworkschool will maybe have school.Course as project_model.

There is now a default text in :meth:`lino.Lino.get_main_html`.
