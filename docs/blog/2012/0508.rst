CBSS connection
---------------

After having fiddled and fought with `lino.utils.xmlgen`, `lxml` and `elementtree`, 
there is now hope that I finally found what I have been looking for:
I discovered the `suds.sax` module for which 
`the docs <https://fedorahosted.org/suds/wiki/Documentation#TECHNICALFYINOTES>`_ say
say that it
"was written because elementtree and other python XML packages 
either: 
have a DOM API which is very unfriendly 
or: (in the case of elementtree) do not 
deal with namespaces and especially prefixes sufficiently."

:mod:`lino.utils.xmlgen.cbss` is no longer used. 
Everything is now in :mod:`lino.modlib.cbss` and uses :term:`suds`.
New table RetrieveTIGroupsRequest.

Added test cases :mod:`lino.modlib.cbss.tests.cbss_tests`
Seems that I'm now ready to run these tests at the customer 
from behind a registered IP address.
This requires to set up a test instance on their server,
and that's for tomorrow.

:checkin:`cf29f855b734` at 1:33, long after I should have gone to bed.

Note: when Lino starts up, 
it generates two files to `WebServiceConnector.wsdl`
and `RetrieveTIGroupsV3.wsdl` into :xfile:`media/cache/wsdl`. 
These are needed for the suds Client, and Lino must generate 
them from the original files provided by the :term:`CBSS`, 
of which the copy is stored in Lino's source repository 
:srcref:`lino/modlib/cbss/XSD` (in fact this is not a simple 
copy but a template, containing a pattern `%s(cbss_environment)s` 
where the real location must get filled in.
There are also (currently) two xsd files 
`RetrieveTIGroupsV3.xsd`
and `rn25_Release201104.xsd`
which are a completely 
unmodified copy of the original CBSS files. But they also 
need to be in the same directory :xfile:`media/cache/wsdl`.
