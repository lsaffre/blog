========

Continued on the "CMS project" (:srcref:`docs/tickets/66`). 
I now use Jinja2 instead of :mod:`lino.utils.memo`.

Somebody who tried the public demo sites found two bugs:

- Calling http://demo2.lino-framework.org/admin/api/countries/Country/BE?fmt=plain
  caused a TypeError "get_window_layout() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)",
  :mod:`lino.ui.extjs3.views`, line 832. This was a simple typo bug.


- Calling http://demo2.lino-framework.org/admin/api/cal/MyPresences?fmt=pdf
  caused a PodError "I cannot write result file
  `.../homeworkschool/media/cache/appypdf/cal.MyPresences.pdf`
  [Errno 2] No such file or directory...".
  The corresponding code forgot to call :func:`lino.core.modeltools.makedirs_if_missing`. 
  By the way I solved a theoretic problem: if two simultaneous requests 
  called a [pdf] version of the same actor, they would generate the same file. 
  Now the filename includes the remote IP address.


After having fixed these bugs I decided to make a quick upgrade of the demo sites.
Which was of course a risky thing after all the changes to :mod:`lino.modlib.pages`.
And indeed it caused the demo sites to be offline for a few hours because there 
were still plenty of issues in the new CMS functions.
