Installing Lino on a server with Python 2.5

Removed some ``import json`` statements which weren't even used 
but caused an import error on Python 2.5.

Temporarily didsabled USE_XSD_FILES in :mod:`lino.utils.xmlgen.cbss` 
because it seems to not work with the older lxml version on that server. Didn't find out which version.

Class decorators aren't yet possible in Python 2.5, so we needed to adapt 
:mod:`lino.apps.pcsw.tests.pcsw_sql_test`::

  #~ @override_settings(DEBUG=True) 
  #~ class SqlTest(TestCase):
      #~ defining_module = __name__  # [Note1]
      
  class SqlTest(TestCase):
      pass
      
    
    
  @override_settings(DEBUG=True) 
  def test01(self):
  ...

A simple "permission denied" when opening the log file took me 
almost half an hour because Django swallows the traceback 
and consideres the failed import as normal. 
Had to hack in ~/snapshots/django/django/core/management/__init__.py::


  def get_commands():
      global _commands
      if _commands is None:
          _commands = dict([(name, 'django.core') for name in find_commands(__path__[0])])
          # Find the installed apps
          try:
              from django.conf import settings
              apps = settings.INSTALLED_APPS
          except (AttributeError, EnvironmentError, ImportError):
              raise # LS 20120430
              apps = []

          # Find and load the management module for each installed app.
          for app_name in apps:
              try:
                  path = find_management_module(app_name)
                  _commands.update(dict([(name, app_name)
                                         for name in find_commands(path)]))
              except ImportError:
                  pass # No management module - ignore this app

      return _commands            



Oops, the following is appearently invalid syntax in Python 2.5::

  html.TABLE(*list(f()),cellspacing="3px",bgcolor="#ffffff", width="100%")
  
  
And oops, even :term:`lxml` builder doesn't seem to work on that old server::

  from lxml.html import builder as html
  
It's a pity that lxml doesn't even seem to tell its version easily...
  
So I'll maybe return back to a selfmade 
:mod:`lino.utils.xmlgen.xhtml` (based on xml.etree) 
for :meth:`lino.ui.extjs3.ext_ui.ExtUI.table2xhtml`.
Still experimenting.
