=============

I started another new application: :mod:`lino.apps.cms`, 
which features mainly the :mod:`lino.modlib.pages` module.

This module is yet young and experimental, and nobody asked me to 
write something like this, but my feeling tells me that this is an 
important piece missing in the jigsaw puzzle: how to use Lino for 
creating "normal" websites quickly and easily.
Where "normal" means "without ExtJS".

I discovered Blueprint and later Bootstrap.
