========

Started a topic overview document :doc:`/topics/names`. 
Work in progress.


Renamed `Actor.setup()` to `Actor.after_site_setup()`.
Renamed Actor.init_label to 
:mod:`lino.core.actors.Actor.get_actor_label`
(overridden by :mod:`lino.core.table.Table.get_actor_label`).

-----------------

Changes in :func:`lino.apps.pcsw.migrate.migrate_from_1_4_3`:

- now converts Companies with `prefix` 'Eheleute' (and an empty vat_id)
  to a Household.
- no longer repair isip.Contracts and jobs.Contracts because users have 
  been told to  do this themselves in the original data.
  
I noted that a households.Household extended contacts.Partner. 
But we'll probably need also the fields 
bank_account1, bank_account2, activity, is_deprecated... which are in 
`pcsw.CpasPartner`.So we now inherit from this class. 
Also the table (households.Households) must inherit pcsw.Partners in 
order to disable imported data.
Which means that the module now explicitly depends on lino.apps.pscw.
