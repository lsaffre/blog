GridPanel navigation
--------------------

Added `selectOnFocus=True` to all fields. 
For both Grid editing and in a Detail form.
This alone makes entering numbers in a grid already easier.

Also started to fiddle with 
`Ext.grid.CellSelectionModel.handleKeyDown` to have it 
call `startEditing` when a data key was pressed.
The tricky part is to then get this data key into the buffer 
of the editor.
