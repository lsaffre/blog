20121124
========

- Updated :doc:`/about/license`.
  Consider :srcref:`docs/tickets/16` as closed for the moment.
  
- :mod:`lino.modlib.tickets` : I want to have a virtual column 
  `time` in `TicketsByProject` which is the sum of the related 
  `Session.time`.
  Thats a simple case of `annotate`.  Did I imagine.
  But :mod:`lino.test_apps.20121124`
  
- Also updated :mod:`lino.test_apps.integer_pk` to latest development.
