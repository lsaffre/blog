Range 1 ends before it started
------------------------------

The server produced a ValueError "Range 1 ends before it started" 
when :class:`lino.apps.pcsw.models.ClientsTest` 
was faced with a contract that ends before it started. 

A nice case of a Murphy time bomb. Lino accepted contracts that 
end before they started. The error message should have come when 
trying to save the contract.

Solution:
New module :mod:`lino.utils.ranges` 
contains utility methods for working with "ranges".
Most of it was previously in :mod:`lino.utils` at the top-level.
But it has one new function :mod:`lino.utils.ranges.isrange` 
that is now used in 
the `full_clean` methods of
:class:`lino.apps.pcsw.models.Person`
and
:class:`lino.apps.isip.models.ContractBase`
to raise ValidationError(
"Coaching period ends before it started." and 
"Contracts ends before it started.".

Even :mod:`lino.apps.pcsw.fixtures.demo` produced invalid ISIP Contracts.

When migrating the customer's data to the new version, we need to expect 
and manually handle contracts and persons that fall into this category.
See :func:`lino.apps.pcsw.migrate.migrate_from_1_4_3`.
