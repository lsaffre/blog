Moved the `AccountType` choicelist

Renamed `AccountType` to `AccountTypes`.

The basic accounting reports
----------------------------

I read the guide 
`Set up a basic record-keeping system
<http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1073789112&r.l1=1073858808&r.l2=1073860617&r.s=sc&type=RESOURCES>`_,
published by the United Kingdom government.
It descibes six basic sets of "financial records":

- cash sales book :
  Date,
  Customer,
  Amount received,
  Cash sales,
  Cheque,
  Credit/debit card,
  Bank pay-in amounts


- cash purchases book :
  Date,
  Supplier,
  Amount paid,
  Paid cash,
  Paid cheque,
  Paid credit/debit card


- Cash Book Summary (Reconciliation) with the following lines:

  | Opening cash balance (A) 
  | Cash receipts (B)
  | Cash banked (C)
  | Cash payments (D)
  | Closing cash balance (E) = A+B-(C+D)
           
  | Opening cheque account balance (F)	 
  | Total value of pay-ins for period (G)	 
  | Total value of payments for period (H)	 
  | Closing cheque account balance (I)	
        
        

- Sales Ledger : 
  one row per sales.Invoice in a given period.
  Columns:
  Date,
  Invoice number,

  Gross value,
  Date paid,
  Payment type (cash, cheque, credit/debit card)  
  
  
- Wages Book (only needed if you employ staff) (...)
    


Centralisation Types
--------------------

I'm still looking for the correct word to group-designate the following three concepts:

- sales      
- purchase
- wages

Background: 
We need a table that holds configuration information which depends on this choice.
The question is: How to name that table? 

In TIM I called it "centralisation types" which wasn't really intuitive.

These transaction types 

Some ideas for a better name:

- Partner Account Types
- Accounting Partner Types
- Partner Transaction Types
